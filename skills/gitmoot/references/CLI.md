# Gitmoot CLI Reference

Use these commands from an agent session only when the user asks for Gitmoot
setup, status, agent coordination, or PR-comment workflow help.

## Install And Update

```sh
curl -fsSL https://gitmoot.io/install.sh | sh
gitmoot version
gitmoot update --check
gitmoot update --restart-daemon
gitmoot doctor [--repo <path>]
```

Verify GitHub access before PR workflows:

```sh
gh auth status
```

`gitmoot doctor` is the environment preflight: it validates `gh auth` (with an
actionable remediation hint) and live-probes the Claude credential selected by
`runtime-auth.env`, so a bad credential is caught before jobs stall. Run it
after install and before starting the daemon. It also reports delegation
worktree count and logical disk size, warning at 10 stale worktrees or 1 GB and
distinguishing aged-final reclaimable owners from pinned non-final owners.

One-shot onboarding: `gitmoot setup` registers the repo and an agent in one
command (`--repo owner/repo --agent <name> --runtime codex|claude|shell
--session <ref> [--role <role>] [--path .] [--start-daemon]`). `--repo`,
`--agent`, `--runtime`, and `--session` are all **required** — setup errors out
if any is missing; `--session` takes a runtime session reference, `last`, or a
shell command.
`--watch-issues` is **on by default** in setup, so the daemon comes up
tagging-ready for `@<agent>` issue mentions.

Home and config: local state lives in the Gitmoot home (default `~/.gitmoot`) —
the SQLite store, `logs/`, `workspaces/`, `evals/`, `artifact_blobs/`, and
`config.toml`. `gitmoot init` creates it, `gitmoot config path` prints the
config file location, and `gitmoot config show` prints the effective config.
Set `GITMOOT_HOME` (or pass the global `--home <path>` flag, accepted by nearly
every command) to relocate everything — useful for isolated test homes.

## Runtime Plugins

Install Gitmoot's Agent Skill into Codex or Claude Code when the user wants the
runtime to discover Gitmoot workflow guidance from its plugin system:

```sh
gitmoot plugin install codex
gitmoot plugin install claude
gitmoot plugin doctor
```

Inspect or build packages without installing:

```sh
gitmoot plugin build codex
gitmoot plugin build claude
gitmoot plugin path codex
gitmoot plugin path claude
gitmoot plugin doctor codex
gitmoot plugin doctor claude
gitmoot plugin codex-launch --repo .
gitmoot plugin codex-launch --config-snippet
```

Claude scopes are supported with `--scope user|project|local`. Codex ignores
`--scope` because the current Codex plugin install command does not use it.
Use `plugin codex-launch` when Codex needs sandbox access to the resolved
Gitmoot home on Linux, macOS, or Windows. It prints a `codex-face --cd ...
--add-dir ... -s workspace-write` launch command, or a persistent config
snippet with `--config-snippet`.

## Runtime Metadata Registry

Gitmoot drives four built-in runtimes (`codex`, `claude`, `kimi`, plus the
subscribe-only `shell`; the legacy `kimi-cli` is also compiled in). Each carries
declarative metadata — advertised capabilities, a default model, an advisory list
of known-valid models, and a descriptor of where token usage is read from. Inspect
the resolved registry:

```sh
gitmoot runtime list
gitmoot runtime list --json
```

The values come from the compiled built-in defaults, overlaid with any
`[runtimes.<name>]` overrides in the config file. Override a built-in runtime's
recorded metadata **without recompiling** — for example to retarget its default
model/effort or record its known models:

```toml
[runtimes.codex]
default_model = "gpt-5.5-codex"
default_effort = "high"
models = ["gpt-5.5-codex", "gpt-5.4-codex"]
capabilities = ["review", "implement", "ask"]
usage_source = "codex exec --json turn.completed usage"
```

Two fields are **behavioral**. `default_model` is the model fallback when neither
the agent nor the job pins `--model`: agent/job `--model`, then `default_model`,
then the runtime CLI's own default. `default_effort` follows the same precedence
after job/agent `--effort`; for Codex, Gitmoot emits
`-c model_reasoning_effort=<value>`. Claude and Kimi do not expose a reasoning
effort argument, so the resolved value is a no-op for those adapters. Every other
field is **inspection-only**, surfaced by `gitmoot runtime list`
but changing nothing at runtime: `models` is **advisory** (Gitmoot never rejects a
`--model` based on it), and `capabilities` gates nothing at dispatch. Adapter
behavior (auth, sandbox policy, session resume, stream parsing) always stays in Go.
With no `[runtimes.*]` section, and with both defaults unset, no model or effort is
forced.

A `[runtimes.<name>]` section can only tweak a **built-in** runtime's metadata; it
cannot add a new first-class runtime (that requires a code change). An unknown
runtime name is a config error surfaced by `gitmoot runtime list`.

## Runtime Ambient Credential Hygiene

Claude runtime auth has one authoritative source:
`~/.gitmoot/runtime-auth.env` (mode `0600`). Manage it without putting secrets
on argv:

```sh
claude setup-token
gitmoot auth set claude             # reads the token from stdin
gitmoot auth status                 # local, masked, no paid runtime call
gitmoot auth probe claude           # paid fresh-session liveness check
gitmoot auth unset claude           # writes an explicit empty file
```

`auth set claude --var ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `--var
ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` select another managed variable. `--from-env` atomically
copies currently set managed variables. The file is re-read for every Claude
adapter build, so rotation takes effect on the next foreground or daemon
delivery without a restart. If the file selects any managed variable, Gitmoot
injects all three names and explicitly blanks absent ones; this prevents an
ambient API key from outranking a file-selected OAuth token. An explicitly
empty file injects nothing and allows Claude's normal ambient/credential-store
fallback. The first adapter build imports legacy `daemon-runtime.env` when the
new file is absent, otherwise it seeds from ambient managed variables once;
existing authoritative files are never overwritten.

Shared injected pipeline keys use a separate operator-owned keychain file,
defaulting to `<base-home>/.config/gitmoot/keychain.env` (override with
`[credentials] keychain_path`). The CLI manages names and grants only; edit the
`0600` file at the path it prints to set or rotate values:

```sh
gitmoot key path [--json]
gitmoot key add <NAME> --mode injected|proxied [--json]
gitmoot key configure <NAME> --upstream <https-url> --auth bearer|header:<HeaderName> [--json]
gitmoot key list [--json]
gitmoot key show <NAME> [--json]
gitmoot key grant <NAME> (--pipeline <pipeline> | --agent <seat>) [--json]
gitmoot key revoke <NAME> (--pipeline <pipeline> | --agent <seat>) [--json]
gitmoot key rm <NAME> [--force] [--json]
```

There is deliberately no value flag, stdin value, or value-derived hash.
`proxied` keys must be configured with a pinned HTTPS origin/base path and
bearer or approved custom-header placement before they can be granted.
`rm --force` removes metadata and grants but leaves the file entry untouched.

Runtime-child environment curation is off by default. Enable it in
`config.toml`:

```toml
[credentials]
env_curation = true
env_passthrough = ["GOCACHE", "NPM_*"]
github = "deny"
model_gateway = false
model_gateway_allow_hosts = ["api.anthropic.com"]
# keychain_path = "/absolute/operator/path/keychain.env"
```

Set `model_gateway = true` to opt Claude into the daemon-owned loopback model
gateway. Each delivery receives a random job-scoped placeholder and
`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`; only the gateway holds the snapshotted real credential and
it forwards only to an exact allowlisted hostname. Gateway startup, credential,
and allowlist failures are fail-closed. The option is off by default and does
not change Codex or Kimi.

With `env_curation = false`, runtime subprocesses inherit the full foreground or
daemon environment exactly as before. With it enabled, the base allowlist is:
`PATH`, `HOME`, `USER`, `LOGNAME`, `SHELL`, `TMPDIR`, `TMP`, `TEMP`, `TZ`,
`LANG`, `LANGUAGE`, `TERM`, `COLORTERM`, `NO_COLOR`, all `LC_*` names,
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `XDG_CACHE_HOME`, `XDG_DATA_HOME`, `XDG_STATE_HOME`,
`GOTOOLCHAIN`, `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME`, `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL`, `GIT_COMMITTER_NAME`,
`GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL`, and `GITMOOT_HOME`.

Codex additionally receives `CODEX_HOME`. Claude receives `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`;
its three managed auth names are then resolved from `runtime-auth.env` at the
adapter seam described above. Kimi, legacy `kimi-cli`, and shell add nothing.
Gitmoot-owned relay, shell-stage, pipeline, and upstream-file variables are
appended after the base and remain available.

`env_passthrough` accepts exact names or a single trailing-`*` prefix glob.
Names containing `=` or NUL and non-trailing `*` forms are invalid. The base
deliberately excludes `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, proxy variables, GitHub variables, and
toolchain caches such as `GOCACHE`; pass through required non-secret operational
variables explicitly.

With curation enabled, `github = "deny"` is the default. All ambient `GH_*` and
`GITHUB_*` values are omitted, including the four token variables. Gitmoot sets
`GH_PROMPT_DISABLED=1` and gives each delivery a fresh empty `0700`
`GH_CONFIG_DIR`, removed when the runtime exits on success, failure, timeout, or
cancellation. `github = "inherit"` is the explicit opt-out: ambient `GH_*` and
`GITHUB_*` variables pass through and Gitmoot adds neither GitHub variable.

Two limits apply: env-var routing is cooperative, not a hard egress boundary —
a malicious agent can unset it; this buys credential custody/policy/attribution,
not enforcement. The strong "agents never hold real credentials" claim also
requires Landlock read-rules for `runtime-auth.env` (same-UID read is currently
possible) — that is P3. Codex/Kimi custody and hard egress enforcement also
remain P3.

## Transcript Retention

Runtime transcript retention is opt-in and invalid or missing configuration
fails closed to disabled capture:

```toml
[transcripts]
enabled = true
retain = "168h"
max_total_bytes = 2147483648
```

Enabled capture appends every engine-delivered job attempt (foreground, daemon,
temporary session, ephemeral, and delegated jobs) to a private canonical log
under `<home>/logs/jobs/`. Externally driven session jobs have no runtime
subprocess and therefore no log. A home-scoped sweep removes settled logs after
`retain`, then evicts the oldest settled logs when the total exceeds
`max_total_bytes`; queued/running jobs and recently finalized jobs are protected.
Seat logs remain transient. Expect roughly 440 MB/week at this host's observed
rate, though workload output varies.

Raw retained logs are mode `0600` and **unredacted on disk**. Treat the Gitmoot
home as sensitive. JSONL exports redact known credential patterns best-effort,
but that redaction is not a vault and cannot guarantee removal of every secret.

## Runtime Launch Sandbox

```sh
gitmoot sandbox probe
```

`sandbox probe` prints whether this Linux host can enforce Gitmoot's strict
Landlock launch sandbox and includes the detected ABI. The probe runs the real
hidden re-exec shim and verifies both an allowed write and a denied outside write;
unsupported kernels return non-zero. Claude/Kimi `produce` pipeline stages require
this probe to pass and otherwise retain the explicit Codex-only refusal. Codex
produce remains on its own native sandbox. Landlock confines filesystem writes but
does not govern network access; network policy remains the runtime CLI's. Wrapped
Claude may write its runtime-owned `$HOME/.claude` state and
`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/claude-cli-nodejs` cache; wrapped Kimi may write its runtime-owned
`$HOME/.kimi-code` state. Apart from runtime state/cache and standard device nodes,
only declared data paths, the disposable workdir, and temp roots are writable.

## Repo And Daemon Status

```sh
gitmoot status --repo owner/repo
gitmoot events --repo owner/repo
gitmoot repo add owner/repo --path <path> [--poll <duration>]
gitmoot repo list
gitmoot repo set-interval owner/repo (<duration>|default)
gitmoot repo set-interval --all (<duration>|default)
gitmoot repo remove owner/repo
gitmoot repo doctor owner/repo
gitmoot daemon start --poll 30s --workers 1
gitmoot daemon start --session <root-job-id>
gitmoot daemon start
gitmoot daemon status
gitmoot daemon logs
gitmoot daemon restart
gitmoot daemon stop
```

For structured local state, use `gitmoot dashboard --json` or
`gitmoot task list --repo owner/repo --json`. `gitmoot status --json` and
`gitmoot task show` are not valid commands.

### Build skew (upgraded but not restarted)

The daemon is a long-lived process: replacing the binary does **not** change the
code it is executing. It keeps running the old build until you restart it.

The daemon records the build it started from in `<home>/.gitmoot/daemon.json`
(`version` + `commit`). `gitmoot daemon status` prints that build and compares it
against the build of the binary **now sitting at the daemon's own path** — the
one a restart would load:

```
build: dev-cd43a49 (cd43a495)
WARNING: daemon running dev-cd43a49 (cd43a495); /root/.local/bin/gitmoot is dev-56ba1c7 (56ba1c74) — restart the daemon to pick it up
```

`gitmoot doctor` reports the same comparison as a non-fatal `build` check. Note
it compares the **daemon** against the **daemon's binary** — not against whatever
binary you happen to be invoking, which may not be the daemon's at all.

Unknown is never reported as skew, and never reported as agreement either. The
comparison is skipped when the daemon is not running, when it was started by an
older gitmoot (no recorded build), or when either side is an **unidentifiable**
build. A build is identifiable if it was stamped (any release, and the documented
deploy recipe) or if Go's VCS stamping supplied a commit — which a plain
`go build` in a git tree provides. Two unstamped builds with no commit are both
just `dev`: indistinguishable, so comparing them would prove nothing.

The web dashboard's `/api/health` reports the daemon's **recorded** build (what
the process is actually running — not the version of whatever binary now sits at
its path) plus, separately, the serving dashboard process's own build. Its
`daemon.versionSource` is `recorded` when `daemon.version` came from daemon
startup metadata, or `unknown` when an older daemon recorded no build; in the
latter case `daemon.version` is empty and must never be treated as either skew or
agreement. This keeps a stale dashboard or daemon visible rather than silently
wrong. The update badge stays relative to the binary on disk, since that is what
an update replaces.

The `gitmoot repo` commands manage the **watched-repo registry**: one daemon
per Gitmoot home supervises every **enabled** registered repo. An omitted
`repo add --poll` stores the `inherit` sentinel, so the repo follows the daemon's
resolved `--poll` / `[daemon].poll` cadence; an explicit `--poll` stores a
per-repo override. `repo list` renders the sentinel as `inherit`.
`repo set-interval owner/repo <duration>` changes an override, `default` restores
inheritance, and `--all` applies either value to every registered repo.
`repo doctor owner/repo` checks a single repo's checkout/config health. If the
registered checkout is missing or is no longer a Git worktree, Gitmoot verifies
the recorded primary checkout, repairs the registration, and reports the
self-heal. Implicit registration from inside a linked task worktree pins the
repo to its primary checkout; an existing valid linked checkout remains usable.

Use `daemon start` for the background daemon. Use `daemon run` only when the
user explicitly wants a foreground process. Keep the default `--workers 1`
unless the Gitmoot home has multiple independent runtime sessions or managed
agent types with `max_background` greater than one.

`daemon start --repo owner/repo` **scopes** the daemon to a single repo: it
polls only that repo's PRs and claims only that repo's queued jobs. Omit
`--repo` to supervise every enabled registered repo from one daemon (#581). Do
not start one daemon per repo on the same home expecting parallel isolation: a
second daemon on the same home is **refused** (`daemon already running with pid
…`; a stale pidfile from a dead owner is liveness-checked, so restarts work
cleanly). To cap one repo's parallelism on a shared (no-`--repo`) daemon, use
the per-repo config keys below instead.

Both `daemon run` and `daemon start` accept `--session <root-job-id>` (alias
`--root`) to pin the worker to one orchestration run. With `--session` set, the
worker runs only jobs whose `root_job_id` matches that value plus the root
coordinator job itself, and ignores every other queued job. Leaving it empty
keeps the default behavior of matching all jobs.

Both `daemon run` and `daemon start` also accept three opt-in flags (all off by
default, so leaving them unset is byte-identical to before): `--watch-issues`
watches open **issues** for `@<agent> ask …` mentions and routes them to jobs,
mirroring the PR-comment watcher; `--scheduler pool` selects the continuous
worker-pool scheduler that re-queries the queue as workers free and reactively
isolates a contended same-repo read job into an ephemeral worktree (fixing a
same-repo dependent-job deadlock), versus the default `--scheduler barrier`.
(Independently of the scheduler, background **read-only ask** jobs — moot seats,
chat-task promotions, autorespond, `agent ask --background` — are each given their
own detached committed-tip worktree **at dispatch** (#739), so they parallelize
across same-repo seats under either scheduler with ≥2 workers.)
`--watch-skillopt-reviews` polls watched SkillOpt review issue comments and
imports valid feedback automatically (see the SkillOpt Exchange section).

To run a repo's queued jobs N-wide, use `--parallel N` (sugar for `--workers N
--scheduler pool`; it cannot be combined with `--workers` or `--scheduler`).
Raising `--workers` above 1 without an explicit `--scheduler` now **auto-selects
`pool`** (multiple workers under `barrier` serialize same-repo jobs anyway); an
explicit `--scheduler barrier` is still honored. `gitmoot daemon status` reports
the live scheduler mode and worker count (e.g. `scheduler: pool, workers: 5`), and
the daemon logs a preflight warning — with the exact relaunch command — when ≥2
parallelizable jobs are queued under a serializing config. Same-repo parallelism
is bounded by **distinct runtime sessions** as well as distinct checkouts.

One repo's concurrency can also be capped **from config, without any relaunch**
(#576): a `[repos."owner/repo"]` section with `max_parallel = N` caps that
repo's in-flight jobs (`0` or unset = use the global worker count), and an
optional `scheduler = "pool"|"barrier"` overrides that repo's scheduler. The
keys are re-read every tick, so edits apply live.

Reconfigure the running daemon without a restart: `kill -HUP <daemon-pid>`
re-reads the `[daemon]` config section (`poll`, `workers`, `scheduler`,
parallelism, `idle_grace_ticks`, `idle_max_multiplier`) live (#577) — no teardown, no dropped jobs, no environment
re-inheritance. Values pinned by explicit launch flags win over the re-read
config. Prefer SIGHUP over a restart when only tuning throughput.

Claude runtime auth is independent of daemon restarts. Use `gitmoot auth set
claude` to rotate the owner-only `runtime-auth.env`; the next delivery observes
it. Use `gitmoot auth unset claude` to write the explicit-empty state. Do not
delete the file to unset auth, because a missing file is eligible for one-time
legacy/environment bootstrap.

An opt-in, off-by-default `[admission]` config section adds a host-global
concurrency budget the daemon applies **before** starting each agent session,
on top of `--workers`/pool and the per-repo locks (#365):
`max_concurrent_sessions` caps total in-flight sessions across all repos, and
`max_memory_gb` caps the summed per-runtime RAM estimate (tunable priors:
`codex_memory_gb`, `claude_memory_gb`, `kimi_memory_gb`, `default_memory_gb`).
With both caps `0` (the default) it is disabled. A job that does not fit is
left **queued** and retried next tick — never failed — so on a small host
"jobs stay queued" can mean the admission budget is holding them. The budget is
enforced per daemon process.

A `[github]` config section installs a **GitHub call budget + secondary-rate-limit
backoff** over the `gh`/API calls gitmoot issues **from the daemon process** —
polling, comments, merges, status (#683). It is enforced **per daemon process**
(like the admission budget), so it does not reach separate foreground processes (a
foreground `gitmoot orchestrate`/`pool`/`review`/`pr comment`) or the `gh` calls a
codex/claude runtime subprocess makes on its own. GitHub's **secondary**
(abuse-detection) rate limit fires on burstiness/concurrency — not total volume —
so a busy daemon plus concurrent in-process calls can trip it (HTTP 403 "secondary
rate limit") and freeze all GitHub ops even while the primary quota is fine. The limiter smooths bursts and, on a
secondary hit, **pauses all GitHub calls process-wide** (respecting `Retry-After`,
else exponential backoff) instead of retry-storming the abuse detector. Knobs:
`max_concurrent` caps in-flight `gh` calls (0 = unlimited, the default),
`min_interval` spaces successive call starts (0 = off; accepts a Go duration or a
bare integer of seconds), `secondary_backoff` toggles the reactive pause (default
`true`), and `backoff_base`/`backoff_max` bound the exponential fallback
(defaults `60s`/`5m`). `conditional_requests` defaults to `true` and adds ETag
validators to the four per-tick polling reads; a `304 Not Modified` replays the
cached raw response at zero GitHub quota cost. `calls_per_hour_warn` defaults to
`0` (off) and logs when this daemon process crosses the configured sliding-hour
count. The count is approximate and daemon-local: foreground commands and
agent-owned `gh` processes are outside it. **Safe defaults:** the proactive caps are off (single-call
latency and steady-state throughput unchanged) and only the invisible reactive
backoff is on. Set `max_concurrent` (e.g. `6`) and/or a small `min_interval`
(e.g. `250ms`) to also smooth bursts proactively on a busy host. Calls are never
dropped — they queue/delay. `gitmoot daemon status` shows the configured budget
(`github limiter: max_concurrent=… min_interval=… secondary_backoff=… conditional_requests=… calls_per_hour_warn=…`).

After `idle_grace_ticks` consecutive successful polls in which every conditional
read is a 304, a repo's GitHub poll cadence decays to 2x and then up to
`idle_max_multiplier` (default `4`; `1` disables decay). Any response-body miss,
poll error, queued repo job, or in-flight repo job resets/promotes it immediately.
Repos with open PRs stay at base cadence because their per-PR comment reads are
deliberately non-conditional. Idle decay gates only GitHub calls; heartbeat,
pipeline, and chat maintenance still wake at the resolved base interval.

`gitmoot dashboard` shows local state — daemon health, repos, agents and runtime
sessions, jobs by state, worktrees, branch locks, SkillOpt train phase/candidate,
and pending interactive prompts.

On a real terminal (stdin and stdout both a TTY) and with no other output/mutation
flag, `gitmoot dashboard` launches an **interactive TUI**: a sidebar of pages
(Attention, Activity, Trains, Agents, Workers, Jobs, Locks, Health, Config)
that auto-refreshes.
Navigate with `tab`/`shift+tab` or `←/→`; `↑/↓` selects a row; `?` opens a
per-page key reference; `r` refreshes, `q` quits. The TUI is the cockpit — every
page can act, and each action runs the same store/workflow code as its CLI
equivalent:

- **Attention** lists pending prompts (`a` answer inline, `d` dismiss) and the
  actual blocked/failed/cancelled jobs with their latest event message
  (`enter` detail, `R` retry, `B` report bug). A red banner appears when the
  daemon is stopped; `s` restarts it with its previously persisted flags.
- **Activity** shows the **live orchestras**: each active delegation root with
  its children, so "what are my agents working on right now" is answered at a
  glance; `enter` opens the request/result detail of a root or a specific
  delegate.
- **Trains** lists every train session: `enter` opens ANY session's live phase
  view (not just the newest), `s` stops a live session (a reason is required;
  same path as `skillopt train stop`), `d` deletes a finished session and its
  history — and, if gitmoot created GitHub repos for that session, a second
  confirm offers to delete those too (never offered for repos gitmoot did not
  create; a missing `delete_repo` token scope shows its `gh auth refresh`
  remedy and can be retried in place).
- **Agents** lists registered agents: `enter` opens a detail with the template,
  recent jobs, and the template's version history — in the detail `↑/↓` selects a
  recent job (then a version) and `enter` opens it: a recent job opens that job's
  detail (`esc` returns), and the list scrolls when an agent has many jobs; `n`
  registers a new agent
  (name, codex/claude/kimi runtime, installed template); `o` starts a training
  session for the agent's template via a pre-filled form (review/workspace
  repos, request, codex/claude backend, optional model — the backend/model are
  stored in the session's optimizer defaults so `train continue` inherits
  them), then drops into the live phase view; `D` deletes the agent (refused
  while jobs reference it); `v` in the detail reverts the template to a
  previous version (same as `gitmoot agent template revert`).
- **Jobs** lists every job with a state summary: `enter` shows the event
  history, `R` retries failed/blocked/cancelled jobs (same path as
  `gitmoot job retry`), `c` cancels queued, running, AND blocked jobs (same as
  `gitmoot job cancel`; running ones show `cancelling…` until the daemon
  settles them), and `B` opens a redacted bug-report preview for
  failed/blocked/cancelled jobs. In the preview, `g` creates or reuses the
  GitHub issue and keeps the issue URL visible.
- **Locks** explains and lists locks, stale resource locks first in red (the
  owning process died; a running daemon reclaims them automatically); active
  locks collapse to a count. Branch locks are released with
  `gitmoot lock release owner/repo <branch> --owner <agent>`.
- **Workers** lists runtime workers (agent sessions). **Health** shows the
  daemon block (running state, persisted flags, log error tail) plus
  environment checks. **Config** renders the effective config with inline
  edits for scalar fields (or `$EDITOR` for the full file).

Form questions are also published as interactive prompt records, so an agent can
answer them with `gitmoot interactive answer` while the form is open. Inline
answers/dismissals use the same store APIs as `gitmoot interactive answer` /
`clear`.

Everywhere else — pipes, redirects, CI, `--plain`, `--json`, `--all`, `--watch`,
`--answer`, `--dismiss` — it prints the one-shot snapshot instead, unchanged. Set
`GITMOOT_NO_TUI=1` or `TERM=dumb` to force the non-interactive path globally.

```sh
gitmoot dashboard                  # interactive TUI on a terminal
gitmoot dashboard --plain          # one-shot snapshot on a terminal
gitmoot dashboard --json
gitmoot dashboard --all
gitmoot dashboard --answer <prompt-id> --value <value>
gitmoot dashboard --dismiss <prompt-id>
gitmoot dashboard --watch          # plain redraw until Ctrl-C (terminal only)
gitmoot dashboard --watch --interval 2s
gitmoot dashboard --web [--addr 127.0.0.1:8080]
```

`gitmoot dashboard --web` serves the **read-only web dashboard** (a live
orchestration/delegation graph with run summaries and prompt/output inspection)
until interrupted; `--addr` sets the listen address (default
`127.0.0.1:8080`). Use it when the user wants a browser view of a running
orchestration.

In the one-shot styled output the dashboard leads with a "needs attention" block,
colors and truncates long lists, and groups near-identical runtime sessions;
`--all` shows everything. `--watch` redraws on an interval (default 5s) and cannot
be combined with `--json`, `--answer`, or `--dismiss`.

## Event Stream (Webhooks)

To notify an external system when jobs finish, configure the off-by-default
webhook transport in the `[events]` section of the Gitmoot config — it is **not**
in the generated default config, so this documentation is its discovery surface:

```toml
[events]
webhook_url = "https://example.com/gitmoot-events"  # empty (default) = OFF
timeout = "2s"                                       # per-POST timeout
# socket_path = ""                                   # reserved, unused today
```

With `webhook_url` set, Gitmoot POSTs a small, versioned (`schema_version = 1`),
redacted JSON event to that endpoint for: `job.finished`, `job.failed`,
`job.blocked`, `job.needs_attention` (an `escalate_human` pause),
`job.deferred`, and the SkillOpt candidate events
(`candidate.awaiting_promotion`, `candidate.auto_promoted`,
`candidate.canary_started`, `candidate.rolled_back`). Delivery is best-effort
(bounded buffer + timeout; drops are recorded as a local `event_sink_drop` job
event, never blocking the job). Consumer rule: **treat a `job.failed` as final
only when it is NOT immediately followed by a `job.deferred` for the same job
id.** Since #532 slice E a deferred run emits `job.deferred` as a first-class
transition **instead of** `job.failed` (no preceding `job.failed`); the rule
still holds and is forward-compatible with the older `job.failed`→`job.deferred`
flap. See `docs/events.md` for the full contract.

## Risk-Tiered Adaptive Review

Scale review depth to a change's blast radius via the off-by-default `[review]`
config section — it is **not** in the generated default config, so this is its
discovery surface:

```toml
[review]
risk_tiers_enabled = true                     # empty/false (default) = OFF
# high_risk_paths matched against the PR's changed files (** = any path depth):
high_risk_paths = ["**/auth/**", "**/security/**", "**/payment/**", "**/migration/**", "go.mod"]
risk_label_high = "risk:high"                 # PR label that forces the high tier
risk_label_routine = "risk:routine"           # PR label that forces the routine tier
```

With `risk_tiers_enabled = true`, each opened PR is classified — **explicit PR
label > changed-path glob match > default routine** (a `risk:high`/`risk:routine`
label wins over paths; a high label wins a label tie). A `routine` PR keeps the
unchanged single-reviewer fan-out. A `high` PR instead fans out a delegation
batch of **refutation-framed lens reviewers** (correctness, security, and — with
≥3 configured reviewers — regression), each prompted to *disprove* the change and
return structured findings `{lens, refuted, severity, confidence, evidence}` in
`gitmoot_result.findings`. The lenses are synthesized by the existing delegation
`synthesis_rule = quorum` engine: **any critical-severity refutation (a `blocked`
lens decision) fails the quorum and blocks the merge**; unanimous approval
satisfies it. The resolved tier is recorded as a `risk_tier_resolved` job event so
an escalation is explainable in the report/dashboard. With the section absent or
`risk_tiers_enabled` off, PR review is byte-identical to the single-reviewer path.
The competition tier (two implementations + a judge) is a planned follow-up.

## Bug Reports

Use `gitmoot report bug` to build a redacted GitHub-ready issue from local
Gitmoot error state. Job reports are fully supported; daemon, dashboard, and
train selectors are reserved and return clear unsupported-source errors until
their source collectors are implemented.

```sh
gitmoot report bug --job <job-id> [--preview]
gitmoot report bug --job <job-id> --create --yes
gitmoot report bug --source daemon --preview
gitmoot report bug --source dashboard --preview
gitmoot report bug --train <session-id> --create --yes
```

Default behavior is preview. Agents should run preview first, show or summarize
the redacted draft, and create an issue only when the user explicitly asks or
the active workflow policy already permits filing reports. Non-interactive
creation requires `--create --yes`.

Created reports target `gitmoot/gitmoot`, include the labels
`gitmoot-dashboard-report` and `bug`, and carry a fingerprint marker in the
body so duplicate open issues can be reused instead of creating another report.
If duplicate search fails in the CLI path, Gitmoot prints a warning and still
creates the issue; dashboard creates fail closed and keep the preview open so
the user can retry.

After creation, report the printed issue URL back to the user. If Gitmoot says
an existing issue was found, report that URL instead of presenting it as a new
issue.

## Agent Setup

Start a new runtime session managed by Gitmoot:

```sh
gitmoot agent start reviewer \
  --runtime codex \
  --repo owner/repo \
  --path . \
  --role reviewer \
  --capability ask \
  --capability review \
  --model gpt-5-codex \
  --effort high \
  --start-daemon
```

`agent start` also accepts the tri-state `--memory[=true|false]` flag. When the
flag is omitted, `[memory].default_enroll` decides whether the newly registered
agent is enrolled; explicit `--memory=false` overrides a true default. This
default applies only to manual `agent start` construction, not hidden pipeline
runners or ephemeral workers. Every successful start prints one memory status
line: `memory: on`, `memory: off (enable with --memory)`, or `memory: enrolled
but globally disabled by [memory].disabled`.

`--runtime` accepts `codex`, `claude`, `kimi`, or `kimi-cli`. `kimi` is the
current Kimi Code CLI (the default choice); `kimi-cli` is the opt-in legacy
Kimi CLI adapter (#546) — the two are the same runtime *family* for
cross-family review purposes. For either, run `kimi login` first and restart
the Gitmoot daemon so it inherits the session. `agent subscribe` additionally
accepts `--runtime shell`, the deterministic no-LLM adapter whose `--session`
is a **command** (the job prompt arrives as `$1`; stdout must carry the
`gitmoot_result` envelope) — the workhorse for deterministic E2E tests.

`agent start`, `agent subscribe`, and `agent type set` accept an optional
`--model <name>` flag that sets the agent's default runtime model. It is a
free-form, runtime-scoped string (a Codex, Claude Code, or Kimi Code model name)
with no allow-list; both `--model X` and `--model=X` are accepted. A per-job
`--model` (or a delegation's `model` field) overrides this default, and an
omitted model preserves the runtime's own default. The same default can be set
in config under `[agents.<type>].model`.

The same commands accept `--effort <value>` as the agent's default reasoning
effort, and `agent run`, `ask`, `implement`, `review`, and `orchestrate` accept it
as a per-job override. The resolution order mirrors model selection: job effort,
agent effort, `[runtimes.<runtime>].default_effort`, then no explicit override.
Values are free-form pass-through strings. Codex receives
`-c model_reasoning_effort=<value>`; Claude and Kimi ignore the setting.

`agent start` and `agent subscribe` accept `--policy` (default `auto`). The policy
maps to the runtime permission mode and decides what a headless job may do:

| `--policy` | Claude `--permission-mode` | Headless capability |
|---|---|---|
| `read-only` | `plan` | inspect/report only, no writes |
| `workspace-write` | `acceptEdits` | file edits only — does NOT unblock Bash (`go`/`git`/`gh`) |
| `danger-full-access` | `bypassPermissions` | full implementation: file writes plus Bash |
| `auto` (default) | *(no flag)* | non-deterministic — inherited from ambient Claude config |

Because of this, an agent that carries the `implement` capability **must** be
started/subscribed with a write policy. Gitmoot fails closed: `--capability
implement` with `auto`/empty or `read-only` is refused at `agent start`, `agent
subscribe`, and at implement-job dispatch with an actionable message. Set
`--policy danger-full-access` for full headless implementation (file writes plus
`go`/`git`/`gh`), or `--policy workspace-write` for edits-only (Bash stays
blocked). See `references/SAFETY.md` for the full mapping and rationale.

Implement jobs own the commit contract: Gitmoot commits and delivers the
worktree's changes after the job finishes, and every rendered implement prompt
carries one deterministic sentence telling the worker not to run `git commit`
or `git push`. Ask and review prompts are unchanged. On the Codex runtime, a
`workspace-write` job whose checkout is a linked `git worktree` also gets the
worktree's resolved git directory (`<main-repo>/.git/worktrees/<name>`) added
to the sandbox writable roots via `--add-dir`, so routine git metadata writes
(an index refresh from `git status`, or `git add`) work inside the sandbox.
The grant is additive and leaves operator-configured `writable_roots` intact;
read-only and danger-full-access sandboxes and primary (non-worktree)
checkouts are unchanged.

`agent subscribe` accepts `--preset-delivery full|referenced|auto` (default
`full`) and `agent update <name> --preset-delivery <mode>` flips it in place on
an already-registered agent. The mode is a sticky per-agent preference:
re-running `agent subscribe` on an existing agent WITHOUT `--preset-delivery`
(e.g. to refresh its session/repo) preserves the stored mode; only brand-new
agents default to `full`. It controls how the agent's installed preset
(template) prompt is delivered on each job:

| mode | behavior |
|---|---|
| `full` (default) | always inline the full preset prompt every job — the pre-existing behavior, byte-identical |
| `referenced` | send a short "use your installed `<preset>` preset (commit `<c>`)" reference INSTEAD of the whole body, but only when Gitmoot has recorded that the exact resumed session already loaded the same preset at the same commit; any doubt (new/`last`/fresh session, unknown session, changed commit) falls back to full |
| `auto` | like `referenced`, and ADDITIONALLY only when the runtime persists sessions (`codex`/`claude`); `shell`/`kimi`/custom always send full |

The optimization is correctness-first and additive: the job payload **always**
snapshots the exact preset id, resolved commit, and content regardless of mode
(so auditability and retry determinism are unchanged), and a preset commit change
invalidates the recorded loaded-state so the next job re-sends the full preset.
Leave it at `full` unless you are resuming a stable persisted session repeatedly
and want to save preset tokens.

Subscribe an existing runtime session:

```sh
gitmoot agent subscribe reviewer \
  --runtime codex \
  --session <session-id-or-last> \
  --repo owner/repo \
  --role reviewer \
  --capability ask \
  --capability review \
  --model gpt-5-codex \
  --effort high

# Deterministic shell runtime: the session is a command, not a session id.
gitmoot agent subscribe stub-agent \
  --runtime shell \
  --session '/path/to/answer.sh' \
  --repo owner/repo \
  --role agent \
  --capability ask
```

Inspect and manage agents:

```sh
gitmoot agent list
gitmoot agent show reviewer
gitmoot agent show reviewer --json
gitmoot agent repos reviewer
gitmoot agent doctor reviewer
gitmoot agent restart reviewer
gitmoot agent remove reviewer
```

`gitmoot agent restart <name>` abandons the agent's runtime session and binds a
fresh one **in place** — the fix for a dead or stranded session that would
otherwise tempt a re-register. It refuses while the session is live or the
agent has in-flight jobs (finish or cancel those first). `gitmoot agent remove
<name>` unregisters the agent.

Delegate to a registered agent from the current local chat:

```sh
gitmoot agent run project-planner --repo owner/repo "Return the plan status."
gitmoot agent run lead --repo owner/repo --task task-001 --background "Implement this task."
gitmoot agent run reviewer --repo owner/repo --pr 12 --background "Review this PR."
gitmoot agent run lead --repo owner/repo --action implement --pr 12 "Fix findings on the existing PR."
gitmoot agent review reviewer --repo owner/repo --pr 12 "Review this PR."
gitmoot agent implement lead --repo owner/repo --task task-001 "Implement this task."
gitmoot agent implement lead --repo owner/repo --pr 12 "Fix findings on the existing PR."
gitmoot agent implement lead --repo owner/repo --task task-002 --base origin/main "Implement from current origin/main."
gitmoot agent ask project-planner --repo owner/repo "Return the plan status."
gitmoot agent ask project-planner --repo owner/repo --background "Write the implementation plan and goal file."
gitmoot agent run lead --repo owner/repo --model gpt-5-codex "Implement this task."
gitmoot agent run lead --repo owner/repo --effort xhigh "Implement this task."
gitmoot job watch <job-id>
```

`agent run --action ask|review|implement` explicitly selects the job action and
wins before the usual inference order (`--task` -> implement, then
`--pr`/review `--head-sha` -> review, then message heuristics). `--type <name>`
has a separate meaning: it selects a managed agent type. The flags can be used
together. Invalid actions and contradictions are rejected before enqueue;
notably, `--action review` requires `--pr`, while `--action implement --pr` is
the explicit existing-PR fix-pass route.

For `agent implement --pr <number>` (or the equivalent `agent run --action
implement --pr <number>`), Gitmoot resolves the PR and reuses its existing task
and worktree only when the PR is open, its head is in the same repository, and
its head branch matches that task. This is the only route that lets a `pr_open`
task re-enter implementation; `changes_requested` remains reusable as before.
`reviewing` and `ready_to_merge`, closed/merged PRs, fork or unrelated heads,
branch mismatches, active implement jobs, live processes, dirty worktrees, and
foreign branch locks are refused. The existing PR number stays on the job
payload so finalization adopts that PR instead of creating a second task or PR.

For `agent implement`, `--base <ref>` selects the commit used to create a new
branch worktree. `agent run` accepts the same flag when it routes to implement.
An `origin/*` ref is fetched before it is resolved, and an unknown ref fails
before a job is enqueued. `--base HEAD` explicitly follows the registered
checkout's current commit. On implement, `--head-sha <sha>` is a compatibility
alias for `--base <sha>`; passing both with different values is an error.

Set a default for implement dispatches in `config.toml`:

```toml
[workflow]
implement_base = "origin/main"
```

The flag wins over the config value. The config value `"HEAD"` keeps
checkout-following behavior. With no flag and no config value, Gitmoot still
uses checkout HEAD, but refuses when the checkout is on a non-default branch
that is behind `origin/<default>`. The error reports the branch and behind
count and offers both explicit choices: `--base origin/<default>` or
`--base HEAD`.

`gitmoot agent run`, `ask`, `implement`, and `review` (and `orchestrate`) accept
an optional `--model <name>` flag that pins the runtime model for that one job,
overriding the agent's configured default. It is a free-form, runtime-scoped
string (a Codex, Claude Code, or Kimi Code model name) with no allow-list; an
omitted `--model` leaves the agent's default model in effect. Both `--model X`
and `--model=X` are accepted.

`--effort <value>` and `--effort=<value>` select reasoning effort for one job
with the same job-over-agent-over-registry precedence. Gitmoot does not validate
an allow-list; Codex validates the forwarded value.

The same commands accept an optional per-job `--runtime
codex|claude|kimi|kimi-cli|shell` override: that ONE job runs through the named
runtime while the agent's registered default runtime stays untouched (`agent
show` is unchanged afterwards). An overridden job never resumes — and never
writes back to — the agent's default-runtime session: it runs on a fresh
session of the override runtime, or on an explicit `--session <ref>` (a
Codex/Claude session id, a Kimi session id, or — required for `shell` — a
command; `last` is rejected because it resumes whichever session is most
recent rather than a concrete one), and its runtime-session lock names the
override runtime so it cannot collide with the default session's lock. Model
rule: `--model` combined with `--runtime` is interpreted for the OVERRIDE
runtime; an override without `--model` uses the override runtime's default
model — the agent's configured default model is never applied to a different
runtime. The same rule applies to `--effort`: an explicit job value belongs to
the override runtime, while the agent's default effort does not cross runtimes.
An unknown `--runtime` fails before any job is enqueued, background (daemon) jobs honor
the override identically to foreground, and a coordinator's delegation-tree
continuations (synthesis, corrective, replan, finalize) inherit the override,
so an `orchestrate --runtime` tree stays on the override runtime across
generations:

```sh
# Retry a hard review through Claude without re-registering the reviewer:
gitmoot agent review reviewer --repo owner/repo --pr 123 "Re-review this PR." --runtime claude
gitmoot agent ask reviewer "Compare the approaches." --repo owner/repo --runtime kimi --model kimi-k2
```

`gitmoot orchestrate`, `agent run`, and `agent implement` also accept an optional
`--skip-native-review-fanout` flag. By default an `implement` job that opens a
pull request fans the PR out to Gitmoot's native reviewers (the configured
required reviewers, or the ones passed for the task). With
`--skip-native-review-fanout` set, the coordinator owns review orchestration
instead: the implement→PR step still records the PR baseline, runs the merge
gate, and records the `implemented` decision, but it enqueues **no** native
review jobs. The skip is honored on both PR-open paths — the engine's
implement-advance and the daemon's GitHub PR-watcher — so a PR opened either way
stays free of native review fan-out. The flag defaults off; leave it off for the
full native review fan-out, which is byte-identical to prior behavior.

When a synchronous `agent implement`/`run`/`ask`/`review`/`orchestrate` job
delivers and **succeeds terminally** but a benign *post-success* advancement step
errors — for example a merge-gate block on the freshly-opened PR, or a 422
"a pull request already exists" race — the command no longer discards the result.
It **exits 0** with the agent result on stdout (in JSON mode this includes an
additive `advance_error` field carrying the advance warning, omitted when there
is none), prints `advance warning: …` to stderr, and shows an `advance_error:`
line in human output. Genuine non-terminal failures (the job did not reach
`succeeded`) still exit non-zero as before. A normal success with no advance error
is byte-identical to prior behavior — no `advance_error` field is emitted.

**Review resilience under branch churn.** A review job is pinned to the PR head
SHA it was queued against; in an active dev loop the branch often advances (a new
commit is pushed) before the queued review runs, leaving the registered checkout
on a newer head. Rather than failing the review on that head-SHA mismatch, Gitmoot
**re-syncs** it: when the PR is still **open**, the review is re-targeted to the
checkout's current head — reviewing the newest commit is exactly what a human
reviewer does — and a `review_head_resynced` job event records the old→new head.
The mismatch is only allowed to fail cleanly when the PR is **closed/merged** (a
stale review of a dead PR is not useful) or when the checkout is dirty. Relatedly,
when a foreground `agent review` finds the agent's serialized runtime session
**busy**, the review is now **left queued** for the daemon to run when the session
frees (a `requeued_runtime_busy` event is recorded) instead of being cancelled and
dropped; `agent ask`/`implement` stay synchronous and keep their existing
busy-session cancel behavior.

Start an orchestra of agents with `gitmoot orchestrate`:

```sh
gitmoot orchestrate project-planner "Plan and split this work across agents." --repo owner/repo
gitmoot orchestrate project-planner "Plan and split this work." --repo owner/repo --model gpt-5-codex
gitmoot orchestrate project-planner "Plan and split this work." --repo owner/repo --effort high
```

The built-in coordinator recipes `review-panel`, `decompose-and-verify`, and
`verifier` run a coordinator that fans work out to ephemeral workers and
reconvenes them in a continuation, with no agent pre-registration. The primary
invocation is the `--recipe` flag (also accepted on `agent run`), which routes
**any existing coordinator agent** through the named built-in recipe prompt
without changing the agent's identity or registration:

```sh
gitmoot orchestrate project-planner "Review PR #123 in this repo." --repo owner/repo --recipe review-panel
gitmoot orchestrate project-planner "Implement the export feature described in the task." --repo owner/repo --recipe decompose-and-verify
gitmoot orchestrate project-planner "Implement the rate limiter and prove it works." --repo owner/repo --recipe verifier
```

The bare `gitmoot orchestrate <recipe-id> "..."` form also works, but the
positional argument must resolve to a **registered agent** (or configured
managed type) — so it requires an agent registered under the recipe name
(e.g. after `agent template update review-panel` + `agent start review-panel
--template review-panel …`). On a fresh install without that registration it
fails with "agent not found"; prefer `--recipe`.

`gitmoot orchestrate <agent> "..." [--repo R]` is sugar for
`gitmoot agent run <agent> --background "..."`. It starts a conductor
(coordinator) that returns a `delegations[]` score; the players (child agents)
then run in parallel or in dependency order, and a finale (continuation)
reconvenes and synthesizes the results.

This uses the same agent registry, repo access grants, cached template snapshot,
runtime adapter, and local job history as PR-comment jobs. `agent run` is the
default coordinator-safe entrypoint because it routes to `ask`, `review`, or
`implement` and keeps branch, worktree, commit, push, PR, and workflow lifecycle
inside Gitmoot. `agent ask` is for analysis, planning, and questions only; it is
read-only, so when the message reads like branch/commit/push/PR orchestration it
prints a non-fatal note and still runs (pass `--force` to suppress the note).
The runtime
plugin helps Codex or Claude Code discover Gitmoot guidance, but it does not
replace the Gitmoot CLI. Synchronous jobs and queued jobs both use the same
runtime session locks.

Configure managed background agent types:

```sh
gitmoot agent type list
gitmoot agent type show planner
gitmoot agent type set planner --runtime codex --template planner --max-background 2 --idle-timeout 20m
gitmoot agent type set planner --model gpt-5-codex
gitmoot agent type set planner --effort high
gitmoot agent gc
```

`agent type set --model <name>` (or `[agents.<type>].model` in config) sets the
default runtime model for that managed agent type.

`agent type set --effort <value>` (or `[agents.<type>].effort`) sets its default
reasoning effort.

Schedule recurring agent work (heartbeats, off by default):

```sh
gitmoot agent heartbeat add repo-maintainer daily-status \
  --repo owner/repo --interval 24h --prompt "Daily status report." --enabled
# implement is policy-gated; --runtime pins a runtime for this schedule.
gitmoot agent heartbeat add builder nightly-tidy \
  --repo owner/repo --interval 24h --action implement --runtime codex \
  --prompt "Fix the top lint error and open a small PR."
gitmoot agent heartbeat list
gitmoot agent heartbeat show repo-maintainer daily-status
gitmoot agent heartbeat enable|disable repo-maintainer daily-status
gitmoot agent heartbeat remove repo-maintainer daily-status
```

A heartbeat enqueues a normal background job on its `interval`. Actions: read-only
`ask` (default) or `review` (`review` needs the agent's `review` capability), plus
the **policy-gated** write action `implement` — it only runs for an agent that
holds the `implement` capability AND a write-granting policy (`--policy
workspace-write` or `danger-full-access`); otherwise it is refused at `add` and
no-op'd (`last_status = policy_readonly`) by the daemon scan. An optional
`--runtime codex|claude|kimi` runs the scheduled job on that runtime (fresh
session) instead of the agent default. `gitmoot daemon status` surfaces each
schedule's last-run/next-due/last-status. See `docs/heartbeats.md` for the full
reference.

A registered single instance **shadows** a managed type of the same name:
dispatch resolves `gitmoot agent <name>` to a registered single instance before a
type, so force the type with `--type <name>` (or do not register a single
instance of that name). Since **v0.5.1** a foreground `gitmoot agent ask <type>`
(the `ask` action) dispatches to the managed type synchronously; background
`run`/`review`/`implement` to a type and `[parallel_sessions]` temp-session
forking use the **background** path. See WORKFLOWS.md → "Running one agent's jobs in parallel".

## Agent Templates

Install or refresh the built-in thermo review template:

```sh
gitmoot agent template update thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review
gitmoot agent start thermo-review \
  --runtime codex \
  --repo owner/repo \
  --template thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review \
  --start-daemon
```

Install or refresh the built-in full planner/goal template:

```sh
gitmoot agent template update planner
gitmoot agent start project-planner \
  --runtime codex \
  --repo owner/repo \
  --path . \
  --template planner \
  --start-daemon
```

Install or refresh the built-in coordinator recipe templates. These are
coordinator prompts for the Orchestra pattern, run with `gitmoot orchestrate
<agent> "..." --recipe <id>` (no re-registration needed) rather than started as
long-lived agents:

```sh
gitmoot agent template update review-panel
gitmoot agent template update decompose-and-verify
gitmoot agent template show review-panel
gitmoot orchestrate project-planner "Review PR #123 in this repo." --repo owner/repo --recipe review-panel
gitmoot orchestrate project-planner "Implement the export feature described in the task." --repo owner/repo --recipe decompose-and-verify
```

For fast current-chat planning, use the Gitmoot skill with the same packaged
`agent-templates/planner.md` instructions instead of starting a background job:

```text
Use the Gitmoot planner here. Write the implementation plan.
```

The current chat can also import any cached custom agent or template prompt:

```sh
gitmoot agent prompt frontend-reviewer
gitmoot agent prompt frontend-reviewer --json
```

This prints the prompt content for the current chat to apply locally. It does
not create a job, start a daemon, resume a runtime session, or post a PR
comment — a free read-only peek.

To track the here-method work by default, add `--record`: it opens a session
job on import (see "Session jobs" below) and returns the prompt with a header
line naming the job id, so the imported work shows in `job list` / the dashboard
once you clock out:

```sh
gitmoot agent prompt frontend-reviewer --record [--repo owner/repo] [--type ask|review|implement] [--json]
# prints:  [gitmoot session job <id> — when this work is complete, run:
#           gitmoot job close <id> --decision <approved|changes_requested|implemented|blocked|failed|skipped> --summary "..."]
# followed by the prompt body.
```

`--record` accepts either a **registered agent** or a bare **template id**:

- Registered agent: the repo comes from `--repo`, else the agent's `repo_scope`
  (error if neither is set); the session job records the agent name.
- Bare template (no agent of that name registered, e.g. the packaged `planner`):
  `--repo owner/repo` is **required** — a template has no `repo_scope` to fall
  back on — and the session job records the **template id** as its agent identity
  (#673). The repo must be tracked (`gitmoot repo add owner/repo` first).

`--type` defaults to `implement`. When the imported work is done, close the job
with `gitmoot job close <id> --decision …`. `--json` includes the opened
`job_id`. Without `--record`, behavior is unchanged (no job).

Draft and validate a captured template before installing it:

```sh
gitmoot agent template draft release-planner
gitmoot agent template validate .gitmoot/templates/release-planner.md
gitmoot agent template add release-planner --file .gitmoot/templates/release-planner.md
```

`agent template draft` only creates the standard markdown structure. For
current-chat capture, the active Codex or Claude chat reads
`references/TEMPLATE_CAPTURE.md` and fills that structure from visible
conversation context. Gitmoot does not extract hidden runtime memory.

Create a local custom prompt template:

```sh
mkdir -p agents
gitmoot agent template draft frontend-reviewer --output agents/frontend-reviewer.md
$EDITOR agents/frontend-reviewer.md
gitmoot agent template validate agents/frontend-reviewer.md
gitmoot agent template add frontend-reviewer --file agents/frontend-reviewer.md
gitmoot agent start frontend-reviewer \
  --runtime codex \
  --repo owner/repo \
  --template frontend-reviewer \
  --role reviewer \
  --capability ask \
  --capability review
```

After editing a local template file, refresh Gitmoot's cached snapshot:

```sh
gitmoot agent template diff frontend-reviewer
gitmoot agent template update frontend-reviewer
```

Template updates are versioned locally. `gitmoot agent template show <id>`
prints the current version, content hash, source commit, and promotion state.
Agents use the current promoted version by default, or a pinned version when
configured with a reference such as `--template frontend-reviewer@v1`.

A bad promotion can be undone: `gitmoot agent template revert <template-id>
--version <version-id>` makes a superseded version current again (the dashboard's
Agents page does the same with `v` in the agent detail).
Queued jobs keep the exact template content snapshot they were created with.

Discover templates by metadata:

```sh
gitmoot agent template list --runtime codex --output goal_file
gitmoot agent template list --tag review --capability ask
gitmoot agent template show frontend-reviewer
```

### Back Up And Share Templates Via GitHub

Templates can be backed up to and pulled from a GitHub repo (#476):

```sh
gitmoot agent template export [<id>...] [--all] [--to <dir>] [--dry-run]
gitmoot agent template publish [<id>...] [--all] [--repo <owner/repo>] [--path <subdir>] [--ref <branch>] [--message <msg>] [--create] [--dry-run]
gitmoot agent template pull [<id>...] [--all] [--repo <owner/repo>] [--ref <ref>] [--path <subdir>] [--dry-run]
gitmoot agent template add <id> --from-repo <owner/repo> [--ref <ref>] [--path <file>]
gitmoot agent template remote set <owner/repo> [--ref <ref>] [--path <subdir>]
gitmoot agent template remote show
```

`export` writes template `.md` files to a local directory; `publish` commits
them to a GitHub repo (`--create` creates a missing **private** repo); `pull`
installs or refreshes templates from that repo; `add --from-repo` installs a
single template file directly from a repo. `--all` on `export`/`publish` covers
only your custom templates — built-ins are skipped. `remote set` stores a default remote in the
`[template_remote]` config section (`repo`; `ref` defaults to `main`; `path`
defaults to `templates`) so publish/pull/add can omit `--repo`; with no remote
configured, those commands require an explicit `--repo`. **Caution: templates
are stored and published VERBATIM (prompt body + metadata) — point the remote
at a PRIVATE repo unless the prompts are meant to be public.**

## Organization registry and scoped dispatch

Organization mode is opt-in. Initialize a starter registry and verify the
required Herdr provider (`>=0.7.5`) with:

```sh
gitmoot org init
gitmoot org brief --role owner [--json]
gitmoot org chart [--json]
gitmoot org status [--json]
```

`gitmoot org validate [--home PATH]` validates the optional local `[org]`
registry and prints its role count. `gitmoot org show [--home PATH]` prints the
resolved role table.

The registry uses `[org] enforce = "warn"|"block"` and
`[org.roles."name"]` entries with `parent`, `scope`, `merge_rule`, and an
optional `pane` Herdr binding (used by org event-rule wakes). There is
exactly one root named `owner`; accepted scopes are `*`, `owner/*`, and
`owner/repo`, and each child scope must be covered by its parent. Malformed
org configuration fails closed and loudly. `brief` records passive last-seen
presence for its role and can render static context with provider state
`unknown` during an outage; `chart` and `status` require a live compatible
Herdr snapshot. When configured, `brief --json` and `status --json` include the
role's `pane` binding. Open escalations remain deferred to #1058's resolution
and correlation contract.

Fresh local `agent ask`, `agent run`, `agent review`, `agent implement`,
`orchestrate`, and `task run` dispatches accept `--org-role <name>` (or the
narrow `GITMOOT_ORG_ROLE` fallback). The role is validated and touched before
dispatch, stored as `acting_org_role` in the job payload for provenance, and
its scope is enforced at enqueue. `[org] enforce = "block"` rejects violations;
`"warn"` queues and records an `org_scope_violation` event.

`gitmoot org escalate --to <ancestor-role> --workflow <label> [--org-role
<from-role>] [--repo <owner/repo>] "<question>"` records an escalation as a
workflow journal note. The acting role comes from `--org-role` (which takes
precedence) or `GITMOOT_ORG_ROLE`; it must be a configured role. `--to` must be
an ancestor of that role, never the same role or a sibling. The note uses the
typed schema `[org:escalate to=<to> from=<from> wf=<workflow>] <question>`, has
the from-role as author, and can be rendered as JSON with `--json`. It
formalizes the earlier ad-hoc practice of typing escalations into notes or
panes; there is no code-level marker to migrate. Phase 1a writes the typed
note, which is visible with `workflow show`; structured escalation surfaces
land with the org brief and active delivery/wake is phase 2. Pane/agent creation
permissions and Herdr checks remain later work.
Event-rule wakes are separately opt-in:

```sh
gitmoot org events rule add --on attention --match owner/repo --wake maintainer
gitmoot org events rule list
gitmoot org events rule rm --home /alternate/home <rule-id>
```

`--on` accepts `escalation`, `attention`, `guard`, `job-terminal`, or `blocked`.
`--match` is a case-insensitive substring matched independently against the
event repo and job id; omit it to match every event of that kind. `--wake` must
name a declared role whose config sets `pane = "<pane-id-or-label>"` (a value
with a `:` is a `wX:pY` id, otherwise a pane label resolved to the current id at
wake time). The daemon calls `herdr agent prompt <pane> <text> --wait --timeout
8000` and treats delivered (`result.type = "agent_prompted"`, or a post-delivery
`error.code = "timeout"`) apart from stalled (`error.code =
"agent_prompt_stalled"`). Rules, pane resolution, and wakes are best-effort; with
no rule rows this path is off.

## External-coordinator workflow groups

Attach a global workflow label to work started outside Gitmoot's own goal/task
coordinator. Labels are lowercase slugs up to 64 characters. They may contain
one `/` to split a namespace from a campaign; each side uses lowercase letters,
digits, and single hyphens with no leading or trailing hyphen. The label is
accepted by `agent ask`, `agent run`, `agent review`, `agent implement`,
`orchestrate`, and `job open`; delegation children and every coordinator
continuation inherit it.

### Require workflow labels

`require_workflow` defaults to `true`. In the default `auto` mode, fresh
unlabeled agent dispatches are filed as `adhoc/<agent>-<yyyy-mm-dd>` and emit a
`workflow_autolabeled` event; they are never rejected. Set `[workflow]
require_workflow = false` to opt a repository out. To reject unlabeled
dispatches, ensure the applicable global or repository policy explicitly sets
`require_workflow = true`, then set `require_workflow_mode = "strict"`; the
required fix is `--workflow <namespace>/<campaign>`. Mode-only legacy
configurations remain in `auto`. Both settings can be overridden per repository
in `[repos."owner/repo"]`. GitHub comment dispatches
always take the auto-label path in either mode so acknowledgement ordering stays
unchanged; engine PR reactions inherit their initiating dispatch's label instead.
`gitmoot doctor` always reports unlabeled-job drift as advisory diagnostics
(including session-open and task-recover rows that bypass enforcement), while
the overview shows that item only for repositories where the policy is enabled.
`gitmoot repo add --agents-md` writes the recommended AGENTS.md discipline
section.

With `require_workflow = false`, dispatch and enqueue remain byte-identical;
doctor drift diagnostics remain always-on advisory, and the overview item
remains policy-gated.

```sh
gitmoot orchestrate planner "Coordinate the dashboard wave." --repo owner/repo --workflow fable/dashboard-redesign
gitmoot job list --workflow fable/dashboard-redesign
gitmoot workflow list
gitmoot workflow show fable/dashboard-redesign --limit 100
gitmoot workflow describe fable/dashboard-redesign "Coordinate and ship the dashboard redesign."
gitmoot workflow note fable/dashboard-redesign "Kickoff." --author operator --status "Implementation started"
```

`workflow list` reports per-state counts, note count, first/last activity, and
best-effort token totals. Its JSON summary also includes the acknowledgment
timestamps `last_failure_at`, `last_human_note_at`, and
`last_merged_receipt_at`. `workflow show` merges jobs and notes chronologically.
The read-only web dashboard shows labels as Galaxy hubs and provides a Workflows
index plus a mission-log detail at `/workflows/<label>`. Workflows are `active`
while queued/running, `recent` when no work is live but activity occurred within
30 minutes, `stalled` when failed/blocked with an unacknowledged failure (newer
than any non-daemon journal note and any merged-PR daemon receipt; other daemon
receipts never acknowledge) and quiet for 30 minutes to 24 hours, and `settled`
otherwise. The optional
`--pane`, `--session`, and `--workdir` note flags persist the latest coordinator
handoff shown on that page. When those flags are omitted inside Herdr
(`HERDR_SOCKET_PATH` or `HERDR_ENV=1`), `workflow note` reads the current pane
label, full runtime session UUID, and working directory automatically. Explicit
flags always win; `--no-auto` skips detection for scripted callers. Detection
is fail-open and never prevents a note, and it does not infer `--author`.
Dashboard resume commands require a full UUID; legacy short session values stay
visible in the workflow index as context but are not rendered into a broken
command. Author defaults to the newest note author.
Each workflow has a stable `description` and live `status`, both shown by
`workflow show`. Description is seeded automatically from a referenced local
issue title, else the first kickoff-note sentence, else the label campaign.
`workflow describe <label> "<text>"` overrides it. Legacy `workflow note
--summary` remains an alias for description and also mirrors the value into the
retained summary field for older clients. `workflow note --status "..."` is the
manual status escape hatch. Each field is stored verbatim and limited to 300
bytes.

For a workflow-linked PR, the daemon adds a structured `[auto:pr:...]` note as
author `daemon` and advances status when the PR opens, checks turn green, and it
merges or closes without merging. The structured workflow/PR/transition key
deduplicates repeated polls; these system breadcrumbs remain distinct from
coordinator handoff notes and never overwrite description.
Labels may be reused; timestamps expose the reuse. `workflow note` stores body
and author verbatim (10 KiB and 128-byte limits) and rejects labels with no jobs.
`workflow show --json` returns those verbatim bytes; plain-text output strips
terminal escape sequences, maps control characters to spaces (except tabs), and
caps each rendered field to one bounded line.

Add `--remember` to stage low-trust repo memory. The default pool is shared;
`--agent NAME` opts into that registered agent's private pool. Exactly one repo
is inferred from group jobs; zero or multiple repos require `--repo`. Note and
observation commit atomically. Prefilter rejection reports the reason and writes
neither. A leading shipping status (`MERGED`, `SHIPPED`, `DEPLOYED`, or
`CLOSED`) with a PR/CI reference is journal history, not durable memory:
`--remember` warns and refuses it unless the caller also passes the explicit
`--remember-status` override. Existing `[memory].ingest_auto_confirm` behavior
is honored.

## Goals

Print the standard Gitmoot goal prompt template:

```sh
gitmoot goal template
```

Import a goal file into local Gitmoot state:

```sh
gitmoot goal import --file GOAL-feature.md --repo owner/repo
```

Start a task in its dedicated branch worktree and inspect task state:

```sh
gitmoot task run task-001 --repo owner/repo --owner lead --base main
gitmoot task list --repo owner/repo
gitmoot task list --repo owner/repo --state implementing --json
gitmoot task dismiss task-001 --reason "abandoned experiment"
gitmoot task events task-001 --json
```

`task run` stores the deterministic task worktree path under
`$GITMOOT_HOME/worktrees/<owner>--<repo>/<task-id>/` and leaves the registered
checkout on its current branch.

`task dismiss` is an explicit terminal action for stale `implementing` or
`blocked` tasks. It refuses planned, PR/review/merge, awaiting-human, unknown,
or otherwise machine-owned states; any live queued/running job, unsettled
post-delivery advancement, unsettled running cancellation, or live process in
the task worktree also blocks dismissal. The default reason is `dismissed by
operator`. Success preserves the branch and worktree, releases the branch lock
best-effort, and appends `task_dismissed_manual` to `task events`. Repeating the
command is an exit-0 no-op with `changed:false` in JSON.

`task events <id>` prints the append-only task lifecycle trail. Automatic stale
dismissals use `task_dismissed_auto`; opt-in never-started-plan retirement uses
`task_dismissed_planned_ttl`; explicit recovery and retry use `task_recovered`
and `task_recovered_job_retry`. A clean closed-unmerged PR records
`pr_closed_unmerged` while moving `pr_open`, `reviewing`, or
`changes_requested` to `blocked`. Once advancement/delegation handling has no
live successor, a terminal top-level implement job without a PR records
`task_blocked_terminal_no_pr` for implemented success or
`task_blocked_job_failed` for another terminal outcome and blocks the task.

### Recover A Dead Implement

When an implementer dies mid-work — its process exits after editing the task
worktree but before it commits, pushes, and opens a PR — the edits are left
uncommitted in the worktree. `task run` (and `agent implement`) refuse to
restart over that state so nothing is silently discarded, and point you at
`task recover`:

```sh
gitmoot task recover task-001 --owner lead
gitmoot task recover task-001 --owner lead --repo owner/repo --skip-native-review-fanout --json
```

`--owner <agent>` is required when recovering preserved branch/worktree
artifacts (a registered implement-capable agent, attributed as the recovery
lead). A dismissed task with no branch returns directly to `planned`, so that
path does not require `--owner`. `--repo owner/repo` is optional — it falls back
to the task's stored repo and is only required when the task carries none.
`--skip-native-review-fanout` persists that flag before the PR is opened;
`--json` prints the machine-readable recovery result.

`task recover` commits the full worktree state (`git add -A`, including
untracked non-ignored files), pushes the task branch, and opens or adopts the
task's PR — the exact finalize steps the dead implementer never reached. If the
worktree is already clean it recovers the commit already ahead of the base
(and refuses when there is nothing ahead to recover).

Recovery is also the only task-level escape hatch from `dismissed`. A dismissed
task with a preserved branch and worktree first moves to `implementing`, then to
`pr_open` after finalization. A branchless auto-dismissed task instead returns to
`planned` and prints guidance to use `task run`. Ordinary `task run`, branch or
worktree allocation, review continuation, and task-state advancement never
resurrect a dismissed task implicitly. Retrying one of its jobs explicitly
restores the task first and records `task_recovered_job_retry`.

Two refusals guard `task recover` (and the `task run` / `agent implement`
restart that points to it):

- **Dirty worktree without an active job** — `task run`/`agent implement` refuse
  to restart a task whose worktree has uncommitted changes and no in-flight job;
  inspect it, then `task recover` to commit/push/open the PR, or clean/stash the
  worktree before retrying.
- **Live process still in the worktree** — `task recover` refuses while a live
  process is still inside the task worktree; wait for it to exit or stop the
  orphaned implementer before recovering.

Planned-task retirement is separate from the default-on stale implementation
sweep. Set `[workflow].planned_ttl = "720h"` only when the repository explicitly
wants old never-started plans dismissed. It is off by default; unset, empty,
`"0"`, or invalid values disable it because dismissal can lose human context a
goal-file import cannot restore. Live jobs, open PRs, remote branches, and
uncertain remote checks prevent dismissal. A write-time allocation CAS also
prevents `task run` from resurrecting a concurrently dismissed plan; recover it
explicitly before retrying.

## PR Comments

Use GitHub PR comments as the public audit trail:

```text
/gitmoot help
/gitmoot status
/gitmoot <agent> review [instructions]
/gitmoot <agent> implement [instructions]
/gitmoot ask <agent> [question]
/gitmoot retry <job-id>
/gitmoot cancel <job-id>
/gitmoot merge
/gitmoot resume <job-id> retry|continue|abort|answer [instructions]
@<agent> ask|review|implement [instructions]
```

A bare `@<agent> <action> …` mention on a PR comment (or, with the daemon's
`--watch-issues` flag, an issue comment) is treated as the same command as the
`/gitmoot <agent> <action>` form (#389). `/gitmoot resume <jobID>
retry|continue|abort|answer` resumes a delegation tree paused by
`escalate_human` or an ask-gate `human_questions` pause — see
`references/RESULT_CONTRACT.md` for the pause/resume semantics (`answer` is
PR-comment-only).

## Jobs And Locks

gitmoot job list --repo owner/repo   # add --json for machine-readable rows
gitmoot job show <job-id>            # add --json for the full job + why-stuck detail

```

### Evidence-graded proof manifests

```sh
gitmoot proof <root-id>
gitmoot proof --json <root-id>
gitmoot proof --verify <service-run-id>
# As with other Go-flag commands, place --home before the positional root id:
gitmoot proof --home /tmp/isolated-home <root-id>
```

`gitmoot proof` is a **read-only**, structured-store projection of the complete
job tree under `<root-id>`. The default output is a graded tree of sessions,
delegation lineage and synthesis rules, reported tests, reviews, commits, and PR
receipts. Missing evidence renders as `-`; `tests_run` claims remain
**reported** with an explicit CI-verification gap. Read-only means the command
opens SQLite in `mode=ro`, runs no migrations, and never changes store data.
SQLite may still create or refresh `-wal`/`-shm` bookkeeping sidecars while it
reads a live WAL database; immutable mode is deliberately not used because it
can observe a torn live snapshot.

`--json` emits the canonical content-addressed manifest. Every node uses a
`sha256:<hex>` content id, parents refer to children by hash, and the root hash
is the proof id. Re-projecting unchanged store records is byte-identical. Core
grading is store-only: content hashes, DAG consistency, and `result_hash` column
consistency can be **verified**, while independent review jobs, job events, and
daemon PR receipts are **observed**. This is internal consistency, not
cryptographic tamper-proofing against someone who can edit the database; signing
is future work. The headline grade tally excludes `integrity.*` meta-claims and
reports those separately on the `integrity:` line. The command never parses
transcripts, contacts GitHub, or mutates store data.

For a succeeded service pipeline run, `--verify` performs an **offline,
store-only** outcome check: the run succeeded, all stages succeeded/skipped,
each jobful stage has its expected terminal structured result, no failed or
blocked job tail remains, result hashes match, and the projected manifest DAG
verifies. It records `stored_pipeline_outcome`; it never reruns commands, queries
CI/GitHub, or upgrades reported test claims. Remote CI upgrades remain future
work. See [RESULT_CONTRACT.md](RESULT_CONTRACT.md)
for the structured result and delegation inputs, and [SAFETY.md](SAFETY.md) for
the read-only and bounded-DAG safety contracts.

`gitmoot job show` reports the model selected when the job was enqueued: an
explicit per-job/delegation model first, then the agent model, then the effective
runtime's configured default model. Text output prints `model: -` when no model
was known; `--json` carries the same durable value on the job row. This is the
enqueue-time selection Gitmoot knew (P1), not a later runtime-reported effective
model; runtime-reported truth is reserved for P2.

When standard output is an interactive terminal (and `NO_COLOR` is unset),
the transcript renders styled: agent turns get blank-line spacing and keep
their line breaks plus lightweight heading/list/inline-code treatment. Tool
calls use type-specific icons; shell output previews its last five lines while
read/search output previews its first 10-15 lines, with exact omitted-line
counts. Tool and turn durations render dim, cancelled tools render yellow,
completed machinery and usage render dim, and failed tool results render red.
Piped or redirected output always uses the plain byte-stable format.

Every transcript opens with an orientation header — job action, agent,
runtime/model (per-job override first, then the agent default), workflow label,
and the redacted, length-capped prompt — so a pane or saved transcript is
self-describing.

`job watch --transcript` follows a cockpit tee log from offset zero and renders
redacted, bounded human-readable runtime output until the job settles, then
drains the file to EOF. It is incompatible with `--json`. Without `--log-path`,
Gitmoot derives the job-mode path under `<home>/logs/jobs/`; if that file is not
available, it prints `transcript unavailable; showing job events` and uses the
normal event watcher. `--log-path` and `--runtime` are primarily cockpit wiring
flags, but remain usable for diagnosis. When `--runtime` is omitted, the job's
runtime override wins over the registered agent runtime.

Fidelity follows each runtime's actual output contract: Codex JSONL renders
live; Kimi stream-json is turn-buffered and kimi-code 0.19.2 reports no usage;
Claude emits only its final JSON envelope, so its transcript remains quiet until
completion; shell output passes through as redacted raw lines. Usage is labeled
`latest reported usage` because resumed Codex counts can be session-cumulative.
Malformed or unknown lines degrade individually to redacted capped raw output
without stopping later lines.

`job transcript <job-id> --export md` remains the deterministic, ANSI-free
Markdown snapshot. `--export jsonl` emits schema-versioned, self-contained
trajectory rows for every normalized event. Bulk export requires the explicit
`--all` guard; `--state` and `--since` filter the created-time-then-id ordered
stream. Bulk mode skips pre-retention or GC-missing logs and reports counts on
stderr, while explicit single-job absence is an error. `--output <path>` uses a
mode-`0600` temporary file plus atomic rename. Oversized runtime lines become
marked truncated raw steps instead of aborting the export.

JSONL export redacts every text-bearing event field with Gitmoot's best-effort
credential masker and has no raw bypass. The source log remains unredacted and
mode `0600`; best-effort export masking is not a vault.

Verified Codex command/file-change events and Kimi function tool calls/results
render as typed compact lines; unrecognized shapes keep the generic/raw
fail-open path. Render-time redaction is a per-line best-effort defense in depth:
a secret split across physical lines may be only partially masked, and the raw
cockpit log plus the external `tail -F` fallback remain unredacted.

### Resumable gates (make `blocked` + `needs` actionable)

When a stage returns `blocked` with a `needs` list (e.g. `needs: ["Maps API key"]`),
gitmoot persists each need as a **gate** attached to the blocked job. `gitmoot job
gates <job-id>` lists them (open / satisfied). Clearing a gate marks the blocker
resolved:

```sh
gitmoot job gates clear <job-id> --need "Maps API key"   # satisfy one need
gitmoot job gates clear <job-id> --all                   # satisfy every open gate
```

When the **last** gate is cleared, the blocked stage **auto-re-runs** via the same
`RetryJob` machinery `gitmoot job retry` uses (re-queued, then dispatched by the
daemon; downstream stages follow the normal delegation DAG) — no polling, resume
happens on clear. Two cases are deliberately **never** auto-resumed even with all
gates cleared: a **session job** (externally driven, #657) and a stage whose tree is
**paused awaiting a human** (`escalate_human` / ask-gate, #305/#340/#445) — a
resource gate must not bypass the human's `gitmoot resume` decision; the command
reports `not resumed: …` with the reason. A blocked job with **no** `needs` records
no gates and is byte-identical to before this feature.

### Session jobs (record "here"-method work)

The "here" method — importing an agent's prompt into your calling session with
`gitmoot agent prompt <agent>` — does the real work in your session but creates
**no gitmoot job**, so the dashboard / `job list` / event stream never reflect it.
Session jobs record that work as a first-class tracked job **without gitmoot
spawning a runtime** — a clock-in / clock-out pair (plus a one-shot recorder):

```sh
# Clock in: create a RUNNING, externally-driven job (no dispatch); prints its id.
gitmoot job open --agent <name> --repo owner/repo --type ask|review|implement \
                 [--title "..."] [--task <id>] [--pr <n>] [--json]

# Clock out: apply the result and move the job to its terminal state.
gitmoot job close <id> --decision approved|changes_requested|blocked|implemented|failed|skipped \
                 [--summary "..."] [--pr <n>] [--branch <name>] [--json]

# One-shot post-hoc: create an already-terminal job (open + close in one).
gitmoot job record --agent <name> --repo owner/repo --type ask|review|implement \
                 --decision <decision> [--title "..."] [--summary "..."] \
                 [--task <id>] [--pr <n>] [--branch <name>] [--json]
```

An `externally_driven` job is created directly in `running` (it never queues, so
the daemon never claims or Delivers it — no runtime subprocess, no runtime-session
or checkout lock) and the stuck-`running` reaper **skips** it, so a session may
hold it open for as long as the work takes. `close` reuses the exact result path an
engine-run job uses: `--decision` maps to the same terminal state
(`approved`/`changes_requested`/`implemented`/`skipped` -> succeeded, `blocked` -> blocked,
`failed` -> failed) and emits the same finished/failed/blocked event, so a recorded
job is indistinguishable from an engine-run one in the dashboard and events. A job
can be closed **once** (it must be a running session job); an orphaned open job
stays `running` (reaper-exempt) until you `job close --decision failed` or `job
cancel <id>` it. A session job is never engine-executed, so `job retry` **refuses**
it (retrying would re-queue it for a real runtime with an empty payload) — recover
one by opening a fresh session job instead. The agent and repo must exist.

**Make in-chat / "here" work show on the dashboard.** The one-step default is
`gitmoot agent prompt <agent-or-template> --record`: it opens the session job *as
you import the prompt* and prints a header naming the job id (see the `agent
prompt` section above). It works for a registered agent (repo defaults to its
scope) and for a bare template id with an explicit `--repo` (the template id is
recorded as the identity, #673). Apply the prompt, do the work, then clock out with
`gitmoot job close <id> --decision …`. That is all it takes for otherwise-invisible
current-chat ("here") work to appear in `job list`, the dashboard, and the event
stream — no daemon, no runtime, no PR comment. Use plain `agent prompt` (no
`--record`) only when you just want to read a prompt without tracking it.

`gitmoot job kill <root-job-id>` is the operator kill switch for a runaway
delegation tree: it terminates the tree identified by its **root** job id
gracefully. In-flight jobs finish normally; the coordinator's next continuation
is routed through the graceful finalize path (synthesize what completed → stop)
and the daemon stops starting queued children of that root. See
`references/SAFETY.md` for how it relates to the other termination bounds.

For a `queued` or `blocked` job, `gitmoot job list` appends a `WHY:` column and
`gitmoot job show` prints a `why_stuck:` (and, when a lease applies, a
`next_retry_at:`) line explaining what the job is waiting on — e.g. `waiting on
runtime session lock runtime:codex:<ref> (held by job <id>)`, `blocked: awaiting
human`, `auth failing: …`, `throttled: …`, `retrying: …`, or a
`blocked-operational: <class>` deferral. The reason is derived from the most
authoritative existing signal (the latest reason-bearing `job events` entry plus
the owning resource lock's lease); a healthy job's output is unchanged. When a
deferral usually needs a human (a dirty or wrong-head checkout), the row/`job
show` also carries a `suggested_action` naming the concrete fix. `gitmoot doctor`
proactively validates `gh auth` (with an actionable remediation hint) and the
Claude runtime token so a bad credential is caught before a job stalls on it.

Operational blockers auto-retry (#532): a delivery failure classified as an
operational blocker — `runtime_auth`, `runtime_quota`, `network_outage`
(transient network/GitHub outage), or `checkout_contention` (a self-healing
branch-lock conflict, or a dirty/wrong-head checkout that carries a
`suggested_action`) — does **not** fail the job terminally. The daemon re-queues
it as **deferred** with a bounded retry budget and a hold until the earliest
retry time, shown as `blocked-operational: <class>: attempt n/3`. `gitmoot job
show --json` carries the `blocker_class`, attempt count, and `suggested_action`.
Over the `[events]` stream the deferral is now a **first-class** `job.deferred`
transition emitted **instead of** `job.failed` (no preceding `job.failed` for
that run). A `runtime_auth` deferral only re-dispatches once a live doctor-style
credential probe passes; the probe failing just extends the hold without spending
a retry. So a job that "failed then reappeared as queued" is the deferral
working, not a bug. Product failures (the agent answered with a `gitmoot_result`,
including `decision=failed`) are never auto-retried.

When a runtime session ends **without** producing a `gitmoot_result` envelope —
the CLI process crashed, exited non-zero, was signal-killed, or completed but
never emitted a valid envelope even after repair attempts — the job records
**failure diagnostics** (#806): a `phase` marker (`launched` = died before any
stdout, `streaming` = died mid-output, `result-parse` = every delivery completed
but no valid envelope was found), the process `exit_code` **or** terminating
`signal`, a **redacted** stderr tail (hard-capped at 2 KB; redaction runs over
the full text with the same token-redaction rules as job comments *before* the
tail is cut, so a secret can never leak partially), and the runtime session id
when one is known. `gitmoot job show` prints a `failure_diagnostics:` block,
`job show --json` carries `payload.failure_diagnostics`, and `gitmoot report
bug` includes a "Failure diagnostics" section. Successful jobs never store one,
and a retried job clears the previous run's crash report.

Jobs stuck in `running` are also backstopped: a running job with no lease
progress past the staleness window (default 30m) is assumed orphaned by a dead
worker and recovered/re-queued. The window is tunable via the
`GITMOOT_STALE_RUNNING_AFTER` env var; the smallest honored value is 1m —
below-1m, malformed, or non-positive values are rejected (with a one-time
warning) in favor of the 30m default rather than clamped (#560). That window is a
same-boot crash backstop, not a timeout: a running job whose runtime-session lease
has not elapsed is left held regardless of the window. After a **reboot** there is
no wait at all — the daemon detects the changed kernel boot id and, on its next
startup and every tick, immediately requeues every job claimed on a previous boot
and reclaims its stranded `runtime:<rt>:<session>` lock, regardless of any
unexpired lease (Linux only; elsewhere recovery falls back to the lease/age window;
#651).

`gitmoot job cancel <job-id>` is the single-job **abandon** verb. It dismisses a
`queued`, `running`, **or `blocked`** job (a blocked job is one paused awaiting a
human — an operator permission gate or an unrecoverable blocker — so dismissing it
is the same abandon intent as cancelling a queued/running one; #631). Cancel is a
single-row transition: it does **not** propagate to a delegation tree, touch task
state, or set the killed flag — abandoning a whole tree is `gitmoot job kill`.
Cancelling also releases any resource locks the cancelled job still owned —
including a stranded `runtime:<rt>:<session>` lock left behind when a foreground
`gitmoot agent ask` was killed — so the next ask on that agent does not wait out
the lock TTL before it can run. Dismissal is reversible: `gitmoot job retry`
accepts a cancelled job (its accepted source states are failed/blocked/cancelled),
so a mistakenly dismissed job can be resurrected.

`gitmoot job cancel --state blocked` is the **bulk** form for clearing a backlog
of blocked jobs. Only `blocked` is accepted for `--state` (queued/running jobs use
single-job cancel; terminal jobs use retry). Narrow the selection with
`--older-than` (a Go duration like `168h`, or a convenience `<N>d` days suffix like
`7d`; age is measured from when each job became blocked), `--repo owner/repo`
(matches the job's payload repo), and `--agent name`. The bulk form is a **dry-run
by default** — it prints the matching jobs (id, agent, repo, age) and exits without
cancelling anything; pass `--yes` to actually cancel the selection. Each selected
job is dismissed through the same per-job cancel path, so its locks are released
too. `<id>` and `--state` are mutually exclusive, and `--older-than`/`--repo`/
`--agent` require `--state`. `gitmoot doctor` warns when blocked jobs older than
30d have piled up and prints this exact command as the remediation.

To automate the sweep, set `[orchestrate].blocked_ttl` to a positive Go duration
(e.g. `blocked_ttl = "168h"`): the daemon's housekeeping tick then dismisses any
blocked job whose blocked-transition timestamp (updated_at, created_at fallback)
is older than the TTL, through the same `CancelJob` abandon path, recording a
distinct `blocked_ttl_expired` job event so a TTL auto-expiry is distinguishable
from a manual `job cancel`. It is **off by default** — an empty or `0s` value
disables it (a negative value is rejected). Unlike `[orchestrate].escalation_ttl`
(which auto-finalizes a whole paused delegation *tree* and is on by default, 24h),
`blocked_ttl` dismisses a *single* blocked job and is off by default.

Merge-gate retries are automatic while the daemon is running. Retryable states,
such as a busy base-branch merge queue or a GitHub branch update in progress,
are retried on the next daemon poll tick. The default poll interval is `30s`
unless the daemon was started with a different `--poll`.

## Result Checks

After a daemon-run job's `gitmoot_result` is parsed, Gitmoot runs a set of
**deterministic, LLM-free binary checks** over the parsed result (#526) — a
contract-hygiene audit that catches results that are technically valid but vague
or missing evidence. Each check is a yes/no question with an explanation, e.g.:

- **implement** — a result whose decision is `implemented` must list its
  `changes_made` and its `tests_run`.
- **review** — a `changes_requested` review must carry `findings` (evidence).
- **ask** — the answer (`summary`/`artifact_body`) must be non-empty and
  actionable.
- **blocked** (any action) — a `blocked` result must list actionable `needs`.
- **coordinator finalize** — a finalize continuation must produce a substantive
  reconciliation summary.

The mode is set in `config.toml` and is **warn by default**:

```toml
[workflow]
result_checks = "warn"   # off | warn | block (default: warn)
```

- `warn` (default) — failing checks are recorded as a `result_checks_failed`
  job event (visible in `gitmoot job events <id>` and `gitmoot job show <id>`)
  and attached to the job detail (`job show --json` `payload.result_checks`, and
  the web dashboard), but the job still finishes on its own decision.
- `block` — a failing check additionally fails the job through the same terminal
  path a malformed result takes (opt-in, for strict workflows).
- `off` — the audit is disabled entirely, restoring byte-identical pre-feature
  behavior (no event, no payload field, no stored record).

A result that passes every applicable check records nothing, so the audit is
quiet on healthy jobs. Failed checks are also stored durably so a later SkillOpt
pass can consume them as structured feedback; there is no SkillOpt behavior
change today.

On a real terminal, `skillopt train run` opens an interactive view of one session
(resolved from `--session` or the newest session of a `--config`): a phase bar
plus a single keypress per step — `enter` advances the current phase (the long
generate/optimizer steps run in a detached background process so `q` leaves the
run going), `p`/`x` promote or reject a candidate, `n` starts the next iteration.
Review-blocked phases show the GitHub issue link to continue from the browser.
`--plain`, a piped stdin, or `GITMOOT_NO_TUI`/`TERM=dumb` print a one-shot status
snapshot instead. `train status`/`continue` print a `continue_from_github:` line
at review-blocked phases. `train start --create-repos` (or the prompt in the
`train init` form) creates a missing target/workspace/review repo on GitHub.

Use `skillopt train` for the product workflow. It pins the template version,
tracks sessions and iterations, validates item diversity, generates temporary
agent options, publishes review packets, syncs feedback, hands off to the
external optimizer, imports pending candidates, publishes candidate review
context, and starts follow-up iterations only after a promoted/rejected/abandoned
decision. Use `skillopt review`, `feedback`, `export`, `import`, and
`candidate` directly only for advanced debugging, custom research runs, or
recovering one step of a train session.

`skillopt train continue` generation is durable and idempotent on resume. Each
review item's artifacts, item row, and options commit in one transaction the
moment that item finishes, so an interrupted generate phase loses only the item
that was in flight. Re-running `train continue` regenerates ONLY the items that
are not yet complete; fully-generated items are skipped, so no duplicate options
are produced and completed work is never rewritten. If a single item has some
but not all of its options/artifacts persisted, resume returns a hard error
(`item <id> has partial generated options; inspect or clear review options
before continuing`) rather than guessing.

`skillopt train recover --session <id>` recovers the OPTIMIZER phase by default.
It re-imports or repairs the optimizer candidate package and classifies the
iteration (for example `already_completed_candidate`,
`already_completed_no_candidate`, `optimizer_active`, or
`corrupted_unrecoverable`).

`skillopt train recover --session <id> --generation` recovers the GENERATION
phase: it reclaims a generation lock stranded by a crashed/killed `train
continue` (whose deferred lock release never ran) and salvages the already
persisted per-item options. Reclamation is liveness-gated — the stranded lock is
released ONLY when its owner PID is provably dead AND it was held on this same
host; a live owner is refused (`skillopt train generation is already running`) so
you stop the running process first, and a cross-host owner requires the lock's
TTL to have expired. The recover process re-acquires the lock for itself so the
salvage is also crash-safe. Salvage is import-only: completed items are already
durable, so recovery classifies them as `expected_items`/`recovered_items`/
`missing_items` and reports `recovery_state: generation_complete`,
`generation_incomplete`, or `generation_active`. The iteration advances to
`options_generated` only with `--advance-state` and only when every expected item
is recovered (regenerating missing items remains `train continue`'s job). Use
`--abort` to reclaim the lock and leave the iteration at `items_ready` (persisted
items are kept). A stale generation lock is also surfaced in `train status` (as a
`stale` active lock, separate from the true current phase).

`skillopt review create` starts a review run for a template and target repo.
Use the default A/B shape for validation, or pass `--mode explore|refine|distill`
with `--options N` for ranked exploration. `skillopt review item add` stores
saved baseline/candidate outputs as artifact-backed A/B review items, or
repeated `--option label=path` artifacts for ranked N-way items. `skillopt
review status` reports whether the run has items, complete artifacts, imported
feedback for every item, ranking stability, pairwise preference count, and a
recommended next mode. Recommendations are advisory; Gitmoot never changes mode,
imports a candidate, or promotes a template automatically.

`skillopt export` writes a JSON training package with the template snapshot,
eval run, review items, artifact manifests, feedback events when present, and
evaluator config. Use `gitmoot-skillopt optimize --training-package
training.json --artifact-root ~/.gitmoot/evals/blobs --out-root
.gitmoot/skillopt/<run-id> --candidate-output candidate.json --dry-run` first
to validate the contract without model calls.
Before real model-backed optimization, check `gitmoot-skillopt --version` and
`gitmoot-skillopt optimize --help`, or install it with
`pipx install https://github.com/jerryfane/gitmoot-skillopt/releases/download/v0.4.2/gitmoot_skillopt-0.4.2-py3-none-any.whl`.
Verify required model/backend environment variables for the installed optimizer
version. `skillopt import` validates a candidate package and stores the
candidate template as a pending version; it never promotes the candidate
automatically. If the candidate package includes new artifact manifest entries,
pass `--artifact-dir` so Gitmoot can verify relative paths and SHA256 hashes
before storing blobs. `skillopt candidate show` displays candidate metadata, eval
report JSON, preference summary, and a content diff against the base/current
version. `skillopt candidate promote` makes a pending candidate current, while
`skillopt candidate reject` records an auditable rejection and prevents that
version from being selected by `@latest`.

`skillopt gate run --candidate <version-id>` runs the off-by-default,
deterministic **pre-canary replay gate** (`#627`, AutoMem A.2): it replays the
candidate against a **fixed, versioned job corpus** and accepts it only on
**strict improvement** over the current champion on the same corpus (a tie
fails). It reuses the `#474`/`#485` deterministic scorers on the corpus outputs —
no new judge, no live LLM in the gate itself; the replay driver is a deterministic
`sh -c` command that reads `GITMOOT_GATE_TEMPLATE_FILE`/`GITMOOT_GATE_PROMPT`/
`GITMOOT_GATE_EXPECTED`/`GITMOOT_GATE_ITEM_ID` and emits a per-item result JSON.
The command prints pass/fail plus per-item deltas, exits non-zero on a rejected
gate, and **persists** the run for audit (`skillopt gate history --candidate
<version-id>`). When `[skillopt].gate_enabled` is on, a candidate must carry a
passing gate run before it may be promoted to canary or current; otherwise the
promotion seam blocks. On a gate failure the protocol allows exactly one retry
feeding the failing replay log back to the optimizer, then rejects.

When `[skillopt].pace_enabled` is on, an **additional** off-by-default
**PACE anytime-valid commit gate** (`#687`) sits on the auto-promote path: a
guardrails-pass candidate is auto-promoted only when a model-free
testing-by-betting e-process over its recorded candidate-vs-champion pairwise
outcomes (the Mode B bandit arm's win/loss tally, `#481`/`#482`) crosses the
commit threshold `1/pace_alpha`. Each discordant pair bets `pace_lambda` of the
wealth (`E ← E·(1+λ(2w−1))`, ties discarded); the gate **stops early** the moment
it is decisive and **rejects** once `pace_max_pairs` discordant pairs are spent
without crossing — so peeking-until-you-win cannot p-hack a promotion (Ville's
inequality bounds the false-commit probability by `pace_alpha`). It is a strictly
additional gate: **every** existing guardrail (`auto_promote_min_samples`/
`_min_score`/`require_external_ci`/`_min_confidence`/canary/replay gate) still
applies, and a non-decisive or budget-exhausted stream **fails safe** to a
`pace_blocked` notify (no promotion). Off (the default) it is never consulted —
byte-identical. Knobs: `pace_alpha` (default `0.05` → threshold 20), `pace_lambda`
(default `0.5`), `pace_max_pairs` (default `200`).

`skillopt binary run --set <file> --run <run-id> --source <file>` runs the
off-by-default, additive **BINEVAL-style binary evaluation** (`#525`): instead of
one opaque scalar judge score, a rubric is decomposed into small, independent
**yes/no questions**, each answered on its own with a verdict plus explanation,
and the per-question verdicts aggregate into a per-dimension **weighted
yes-fraction** and a weighted-mean **overall** score. The **question set** is a
YAML or JSON file (`{version: 1, template_or_task_kind, dimensions: [{name,
weight, questions: [{id, text, violation_example, weight}]}]}`); ids must be
unique and weights default to `1`. `--deterministic` uses a **rule-based runner**
(no LLM) that answers each question purely from optional
`contains`/`not_contains`/`regex`/`not_regex` assertions on the question — the
reproducible/test mode. Without `--deterministic`, `--reviewer <runtime>` selects
an **opt-in LLM-backed runner** wired through the same cross-family judge plumbing
as `skillopt ab --judge`, so each question is answered by a *different* family
(never a self-preference), read-only. Verdicts persist to the additive
`skillopt_binary_verdicts` table keyed by `(run_id, question_id)` and are re-read
by `skillopt binary show --run <run-id>`. Each row also stores the
`question_weight`/`dimension_weight` the run used (default `1`), so `show`
re-aggregates with the same weighting and reports the **identical** per-dimension
and overall scores `run` emitted (even for non-uniform weights). They also ride the training-package
export as an **optional** `binary_verdicts` section (omitempty — verdict-less
packets are byte-identical). The per-dimension scores map onto the existing
`EvaluatorScore.DimensionScores` shape with **no contract change**. Nothing here
runs unless a `skillopt binary` command is invoked — every existing SkillOpt
review/optimize flow is byte-identical when it is unused.

`skillopt binary lessons --template <id>` turns the per-question verdicts already
recorded for a template into **optimizer-consumable prompt-update lessons**
(`#527`, BINEVAL §3.3/§3.4). It compares verdicts across every run of the
template — candidate-vs-champion (different versions) **and** repeated runs of one
version (instability) — and classifies each question: a verdict that **flips**
across runs is an unstable, targeted improvement signal; a **stable NO** is a
concrete failure lesson; a **stable YES** is a trait to preserve. It **previews by
default and writes nothing**. With `--apply` it projects the lessons onto
`RankedFeedbackEvent` rows via the existing store API (`source=binary-disagreement`;
negative lessons → `required_improvements`, stable-pass traits → `useful_traits`)
so the **existing** optimizer + `skillopt rubric induce` consume them with **zero
contract change**. `--set <file>` supplies the question set so lessons recover the
question wording (the verdicts table stores only ids); `--run <id>` (repeatable)
restricts to specific runs; `--no-passes` drops the stable-pass traits. There is
**no daemon or automatic path** — writes are CLI-explicit only, mirroring the
`skillopt synth` approval gate, and re-applying is idempotent: `--apply` is a
**full replace** of a deterministic per-template synthetic run (its prior events
are cleared and rewritten), so a shrinking lesson set — e.g. re-running with
`--no-passes`, a narrower `--run` filter, or no lessons at all — removes the
stale events rather than leaving them to feed the optimizer. The synthetic
events carry no fabricated pairwise preference (neutral tie group, no winner):
the lesson lives entirely in `required_improvements`/`useful_traits`.

`skillopt pairwise import <packet-dir>` ingests a **blinded paired-review
packet** produced by the gitmoot-skillopt fork (the `pairwise-review.json`
packet plus its secret map and the reviewer's picks), de-blinds it, and stores
the pairwise-preference feedback events — the import path for Mode B's
paired-review evidence. The daemon can also import review-issue feedback
automatically when started with `--watch-skillopt-reviews`.

`skillopt synth --template <id> --repo owner/repo --strong <agent>` is the
off-by-default, **explicit opt-in** Autodata-style synthetic review-item
generator (`#535`). There is NO daemon/auto integration — nothing runs it but
you. `--strong` is required; **`--weak` is optional** and defaults to the target
template's **current champion version** (`#741`): omit it and the weak attempt
runs as an ephemeral agent pinned to exactly that version, delivered with the
champion's own template instructions injected as its role frame (the same
template-content seam temp/ephemeral workers use). The point is that an accepted
item — weak struggles, strong solves — is then by construction a documented
**champion weakness**: the loop targets the champion's own failures rather than,
say, a cross-family weak agent's, which is what the optimizer needs to clear its
anti-regression gate. The default weak runtime is the template's first declared
`runtime_compatibility` entry (falling back to `codex`). Pass `--weak <agent>`
to keep the explicit-agent behavior unchanged. For each of up to `--max-items`
(default 3) items it runs a loop through the SAME runtime-adapter path the A/B
path uses: a **Challenger** (the `--challenger` agent, default the strong agent)
writes a `{context, question, rubric}`; the weak (champion by default) and
`--strong` agents each attempt it; a
`--judge` (default the strong agent) scores both answers against the rubric and
flags well-formedness. Without a diversity quota, an item is **accepted** only
when the strong agent meaningfully beats the weak agent (score gap ≥ `--gap`,
default 0.20) AND the
judge confirms the item is well-formed; otherwise the round records a
diagnostic (`too_easy`, `too_hard`, `strong_failed`, `bad_rubric`, or
`context_leak`) and the Challenger regenerates with targeted feedback until
accepted or `--max-rounds-per-item` (default 3) is exhausted. Every
challenger/weak/strong/judge delivery is **sandboxed** into a fresh per-item temp
scratch dir (never a registered repo checkout) and framed with an answer-only
preamble, so an agentic-CLI attempt can never write files, start servers, or
modify a live checkout while "answering" the exercise (`#725`); the scratch dir
is deleted when the item finishes.

Two independent opt-ins broaden the candidate search without changing the
default path. `--diversity-quota N` salvages up to N otherwise-`too_easy` items
as `kind=diversity`, but only after a slot exhausts every refinement round
without a discriminating item. The most recent well-formed `too_easy` candidate
is kept, so a diversity item never displaces a discriminating item. Those
exceptions remain `pending_human_approval` and are segmented from discriminating
champion weaknesses for human review and PACE analysis. Other rejection
diagnostics never consume the quota. `--novelty-injection` selects one active,
confirmed memory
from the shared pool that is visible to the target repo and outside the
guidance anchor's top-level cluster, then offers it only to the Challenger as an
optional, untrusted weave-in. If the guidance has no clustered anchor, selection
falls back to uniform sampling across visible clusters; if no eligible clustered
fact exists, the feature logs one note and safely no-ops. The injected fact never
enters weak, strong, or judge prompts.

Accepted items are
written to `--out` (default `<home>/evals/synth`) and stored in the DB with
status `pending_human_approval`. They are **structurally isolated**: nothing in
the promotion/training path reads the synth table, so a pending item can never
affect a promotion. `skillopt synth list [--status ...]` shows them; `skillopt
synth approve <item-id>` / `skillopt synth reject <item-id>` is the load-bearing
human gate — only an approved item is cleared for later manual inclusion in a
review pool. Skipped/rejected candidates are logged with their diagnostic and
never persisted. Item files and `skillopt synth list --json` include `kind` and
`injected_memory_key` only when set; text list output marks non-empty kinds.

At the manual promote/reject gate, Gitmoot records every judge↔human outcome
into a local store — all four directions: `agree_accept`, `agree_reject`,
`judge_accept_human_reject` (judge accepts, human rejects — a false positive),
and `judge_reject_human_accept` (judge rejects, human accepts — a false
negative). Each outcome is tagged with the judge prompt version, evaluator id,
and prompt hash that produced the score, so later analysis can compare judges by
prompt revision. This capture is measurement only: it never changes the judge,
overrides a decision, or bumps the result contract.

`skillopt judge-report` reads those captured outcomes and reports how well the
LLM judge is calibrated against human verdicts. It prints a confusion matrix
(the four `direction` buckets), the agreement rate and Cohen's κ, calibration
buckets (judge soft-score versus the human decision), and per-dimension
disagreement. Pass `--template <id>` to scope the report to one template, and
`--home <path>` to read from a non-default Gitmoot home. It is read-only.

`skillopt judge agreement` is the judge↔human agreement measurement harness
(#344). It joins the stored A/B judge verdicts (`skillopt ab --judge` /
jury rows) against the human ranked/pairwise feedback on the same
**comparison**: each `skillopt ab` invocation stamps a shared per-comparison
token on all of its rows, so repeated A/Bs of one challenger stay separate
observations (older tokenless rows are excluded and counted as unmeasurable,
never pooled; internal ties within one comparison are skipped and counted).
It reports Cohen's κ as the **headline** metric (raw agreement overstates
judge quality because it does not correct for chance), the raw agreement
rate, per-human-source and per-juror-family breakdowns, an
assignment-corrected position-bias audit over judge rows that carry the
recorded raw a/b pick (`P(pick=a)` stratified by the champion's presented
position and reported alongside `P(option A = champion)`; undefined when a
fixed `--seed` pinned the champion to one position), and a summary of the
candidate-level judge outcomes above. Small samples get a loud warning —
sample size is the limiter. `--json` emits the machine-readable report. It is
read-only.

`skillopt rubric induce` is the **offline, deterministic rubric-induction**
tool (#344/#347, AutoLibra-style — 2505.02820). It reads the human feedback
already captured for a template (the `useful_traits` / `rejected_traits` /
`required_improvements` on ranked feedback events, across all of that
template's runs) and **induces a criterion-separated rubric** from it, then
freezes it as reviewed static JSON. The pipeline is fully offline (no LLM
calls, so it is reproducible and testable): (1) **ground** each trait string
into an aspect `{text, sign +/-, source_event_id}`; (2) **cluster** aspects by
normalized token-overlap (Jaccard, greedy single-linkage, stable ordering)
into up to six metrics, each `{name, definition, positive_examples,
negative_examples, source_event_ids}`; (3) **meta-evaluate** on a held-out
split — `coverage` (fraction of held-out aspects a metric matches) and
`redundancy` (max inter-metric similarity, lower is better); (4) **write**
`rubric.json` (the frozen rubric, `{version, template, metrics[...]}`),
`report.json`, and a human-readable `report.txt` under `--out` (default
`<home>/skillopt/rubrics/<template>`). Flags: `--template <id>` (required),
`--holdout 0.2` (fraction reserved for coverage; `0` keeps in-sample),
`--min-events N` (minimum usable feedback events, hard floor 3),
`--home <path>`, and `--json` (emits the report plus the artifact paths). It
errors with an actionable message and a non-zero exit when there are fewer than
three usable feedback events or fewer than two separable metric clusters. The
token-overlap clusterer is the deterministic v1; swapping in AutoLibra's LLM
thematic clustering is a clearly-marked extension point that changes only the
clustering step, leaving grounding, the held-out meta-eval, and the emitted
contract identical.

The tool is **read-only over the store and human-gated**: it only writes files
and never injects anywhere. To adopt an induced rubric, a human reviews
`rubric.json` and maps its metrics onto gitmoot-skillopt's
`evaluator_config['rubric']` — one dimension per metric, with the metric
`name` as the dimension key, its `definition` (and `positive_examples` /
`negative_examples`) as the description, and a weight the reviewer chooses.
Because `_compose_evaluator_rubric` already merges arbitrary
`evaluator_config['rubric']` dimensions and `_normalize_dimension_list`
accepts arbitrary names, this needs **zero judge-code change and no result
contract bump**. For example a metric named `clarity / headline / copy` becomes
`evaluator_config['rubric'] = {"clarity / headline / copy": {"description":
"<definition + examples>", "weight": 1.0}}`.

`skillopt judge promote` closes the judge-prompt optimization loop: it applies an
**accepted** judge-prompt variant (from the judge-prompt optimizer's
`gitmoot-skillopt-judge-candidate` package) into a template, so the next
skill-opt run judges with the improved prompt. Select the variant with
`--task-kind <kind>` (use `_global` for the all-items pass). It **previews by
default** — printing the template id, task kind, the `baseline→best` agreement
delta, and a truncated prompt preview, and writing nothing — and requires
`--yes` to apply. It refuses (hard error) any variant whose `accepted` is not
true or whose `best_prompt` is empty, and any task kind missing from the package.
On apply it writes the prompt into the template's `evaluation` metadata
(`judge_prompt_templates` keyed by task kind, **merging** so other task kinds are
preserved, plus a bumped `judge_prompt_version`) and records a
`skillopt_judge_outcomes` audit row (`human_decision=promoted`, the old→new
version, and the agreement delta in `reason`). `--json` emits the machine-readable
preview/apply summary.

The Markdown feedback collector writes blind A/B review packets with `index.md`,
per-item Markdown files, editable `feedback.yml`, and hidden assignment metadata
that Gitmoot uses to validate the full response and import de-blinded canonical
feedback events. Open `index.md`, review every file in `items/*.md`, set
`reviewer`, edit `feedback.yml` with exactly one of `a`, `b`, `tie`, `neither`,
or `skip` for every item, and leave `.assignments.json` untouched.
Ranked packets use the same files, but `feedback.yml` contains ordered rankings
plus optional `useful_traits`, `rejected_traits`, and reasoning. After feedback
exists, packet summaries hide outcome-bearing phase details so later blind
reviewers do not see the current winner before responding.

The GitHub feedback collector publishes the same blind A/B review packet to a
new issue by default, or to an existing PR when `--pr <number>` is provided.
Repository resolution uses `--repo`, then the eval run target repo, then the
template source repo, then optional `[feedback].repo = "owner/reviews"` in
Gitmoot config. Reviewers can reply with full YAML or run-scoped short-form
lines such as `run_id: run-1` followed by `item-001: b - More concrete.`.
`github sync` imports valid comments into canonical feedback events and ignores
unrelated comments safely.
Ranked GitHub comments can use `item-001 ranking: C > A > D > B` plus trait
notes. Use the ranked workflow for exploration/refinement and return to A/B
validation for final promotion decisions on fresh items.

## Agent Memory

Agent persistent memory (#626) gives an enrolled agent a repo-filtered pool of
durable *facts* ("this repo's arm64 CI is flaky") that Gitmoot injects into the
job prompt as a reference-only block. It is **off by default** and, in the
current phase, runs in **observation mode**: the injectable ("confirmed") tier
is populated only by Gitmoot's own deterministic mechanical facts, while
agent-returned learnings are logged for measurement but never injected.

Gitmoot writes a mechanical fact only when a terminal job carries a genuine,
bounded signal — never one fact per job (#645):

- **Fix-round facts** — when a job reached its decision only after one or more
  corrective verify/retry rounds ("recent implement jobs here needed up to N fix
  rounds"), keyed by decision.
- **Terminal-outcome candidates** — ordinary `changes_requested` outcomes are
  considered, but a substantiveness gate requires at least one concrete job id,
  PR number, error string, file, or count. The generic "some review jobs here
  concluded with changes requested" shape is suppressed. Routine successes and
  anomalous one-off `failed`/`blocked` terminals also write nothing.

Facts are keyed by low-cardinality **closed** categories, never free-form
content: the outcome is a validated decision value and the action is collapsed to
a small fixed allowlist (a delegation's free-form action buckets to a generic
token). So repeated jobs UPSERT the same row rather than growing the pool, and
every fact passes the same deterministic write filters as agent learnings.

**Distill-at-terminal (#737 P4.1)** is an optional, config-gated producer
(`distill_at_terminal`, off by default). On an *anomalous* terminal
(`failed`/`blocked`/`changes_requested`) it mines the job's own result for two
closed-category signals and stages them as **pending observations** — trust
`low`, provenance `distill:<job-id>`, and **never confirmed memory** (the
`memory confirm` gate stays the only promotion path):

- **Failing tests** — one normalized key per test whose failure is **explicit** in
  the job output (a `--- FAIL:` marker), not merely present in `tests_run` (which
  records only that a test was *run*, not that it failed).
- **Named errors** — stable error tokens pulled from the result summary (and the
  tail of the raw output), normalized to a closed category by stripping hashes,
  paths, addresses, line numbers, and timestamps.

Distill is bounded on every axis: each candidate passes the same **PreFilter** as
learnings, content-hash **dedup** blocks a repeat from staging twice, and
`distill_max_per_job` caps writes per job. A **recurrence gate** prevents a
one-off failure from ever becoming a pending memory: the first sighting of a
normalized key records only a low-trust *witness* (provenance
`distill-seen:<job-id>`); the observation stages only when the same key recurs in
a later job. A witness is internal recurrence bookkeeping — it is **never** shown
by `memory list` and can **never** be promoted by `memory confirm` (both the list
and confirm surfaces exclude the `distill-seen:` provenance), so a one-off failure
stays invisible until it recurs. By default distill follows enrollment; set `distill_all_jobs = true`
to harvest failure signal box-wide (the read path and confirmed producers stay
enrolled-only).

**Success distill (#781)** is separately gated by `distill_successes` (off by
default). It adds two deterministic, no-LLM producers, both pending-only with
trust `low`:

- **SkillOpt promotions** stage one observation when a candidate is promoted. The
  key is bounded by template version and content hash, for example
  `skillopt:<template>@vN-promoted:<hash>`. The content records which version was
  promoted over which base, plus cheap local evidence such as review score,
  replay-gate mean scores, and recorded weaknesses when present.
- **Recovered failures** run when a later job succeeds. Gitmoot looks for active
  confirmed failure facts with `distill:` provenance whose `source_job` belongs
  to the same task lineage as the successful job, using matching `task_id` when
  both jobs have one, otherwise the same repo plus branch. It appends a low-trust
  pending observation on the same key that names the successful job, date, and
  branch. It does not mutate, retire, or auto-upgrade the confirmed failure fact.

Success distill uses the same PreFilter and observation dedup path as other
memory observations. Recovered-failure writes share `distill_max_per_job`; SkillOpt
promotion writes are one observation per promotion event.

Enrollment is per agent, plus optional global knobs:

```toml
[agents.builder]
runtime = "codex"
memory = true          # enroll this agent (default off)

[memory]
disabled = false            # global kill switch (overrides every enrollment)
default_enroll = false      # enroll agents created by manual agent start unless explicitly overridden
token_budget = 1500         # cap on injected block size (estimated tokens)
max_entries = 15            # cap on confirmed rows considered for injection
distill_at_terminal = false # stage deterministic failure signal at job terminal (#737 P4.1)
distill_successes = false   # stage deterministic success observations (#781)
distill_max_per_job = 3     # hard cap on distilled observations per job
distill_all_jobs = false    # when true, distill runs for every job, not only enrolled agents
ingest_auto_confirm = false # when true, ingest/chat remember confirm to the authoring agent private pool only
harvest_enabled = false     # sweep new terminal results for durable insights
harvest_runtime = "codex"   # read-only one-shot classifier runtime
harvest_model = ""          # empty uses the runtime default
harvest_effort = "low"
harvest_max_per_job = 2     # maximum pending observations staged from one job
harvest_max_jobs_per_sweep = 5 # maximum jobs classified per one-minute sweep
groom_split_llm = false     # default-off LLM boundary chooser after deterministic splitting
groom_split_llm_runtime = "codex"
groom_split_llm_model = "" # empty uses the runtime default
groom_split_llm_max_per_run = 5
groom_quality = false       # shadow audit; true permits corroborated retirements
groom_quality_max_per_run = 8
groom_quality_min_age = "24h"
groom_llm_total_max_per_run = 10 # shared across quality, stale, and split calls
groom_stale = true          # detect expired operational-status batons
groom_stale_age = "336h"   # newest content date must be older than 14d
```

Daemon-consumed `[memory]` keys are hot-read without restart; `default_enroll`
is read on each manual `agent start`. Flipping `distill_at_terminal` or
`distill_successes` takes effect on the next job.

### Insight harvest

`harvest_enabled` starts a durable daemon sweep over newly persisted terminal
job results. Enabling it initializes a high-water mark at the current job
history, so it does not silently backfill older results. Cheap filters and
exact-fingerprint dedup run before any model call; explicit result `learnings`
pass through the same safety filters without classification. Other eligible
results are projected to summary and findings only, then sent as untrusted data
to a fresh read-only one-shot classifier.

Harvested insights are staged as low-trust, repo-scoped observations in the
shared owner pool, with the executing agent retained as author. They remain
pending for human review through `memory confirm`; harvest provenance is never
eligible for automatic confirmation, even when `ingest_auto_confirm = true`.
Receipts make completed and skipped jobs idempotent. A classifier attempt whose
outcome cannot be proved is marked uncertain and surfaced in daemon status
instead of being retried automatically.

An agent returns durable facts via the optional top-level `learnings` field in
`gitmoot_result` — each entry is `{key, scope ("repo"|"general"), content}`.
Most jobs return none. Returned learnings are shadow-logged only (never injected
in this phase) and pass deterministic pre-filters that reject directive-phrased,
executable, secret-shaped, or non-repo-agnostic content.

Inspect, curate, and measure the store:

```sh
gitmoot memory list [--pending|--confirmed] [--agent NAME] [--repo owner/repo] [--json]
gitmoot memory recall "<query>" [--repo owner/repo] [--agent NAME|--shared] [--limit N] [--expand] [--json]
gitmoot memory replay [--agent NAME] [--repo owner/repo] [--limit N] [--json]
gitmoot memory eval --fixtures evals/memory-retrieval-fixtures.json [--k N] [--json]
gitmoot memory vault export [--out DIR] [--agent NAME] [--force] [--json]
gitmoot memory vault import <DIR> [--dry-run|--yes] [--json]
gitmoot memory links backfill [--dry-run] [--json]
gitmoot memory links list <id> [--json]
gitmoot memory log [--key K] [--agent A] [--repo R] [--kind k1,k2] [--since 168h] [--limit N] [--json]
gitmoot memory log --id <memory-id> [--json]
gitmoot memory log backfill [--dry-run] [--json]
```

`memory list` shows confirmed memories and/or pending observations. `memory
recall` runs the same FTS5/BM25 confirmed-memory retrieval used for prompt
injection and prints the matching facts in injection bullet format. Without
`--agent`, recall searches all agent owner pools plus the shared pool; pass
`--agent NAME` to inspect that agent's private pool plus shared, or `--shared`
to inspect only shared facts. Without `--repo`, recall searches every repo and
general-scope facts. `--repo owner/repo` narrows repo-scoped facts to that repo
while still including general-scope facts. `--expand` follows one hop of
persisted memory links from the direct matches, appending visible linked facts
after every direct match and marking their bullets with `[linked]`. `--json`
returns raw rows for scripts, including `author_ref` when a shared fact preserves
a different author and `linked_from` when a row came from link expansion.
`memory replay` is an offline A/B:
it re-renders recent real jobs' prompts with and
without the learnings block and reports the injection delta (added tokens,
entries injected) — it measures injection *mechanics*, not outcome quality
(running real agents twice is a later-phase gate). `memory eval` computes
recall/precision through the production `PreviewEntries` path over a labeled
fixtures file. The versioned 44-case exam is
`evals/memory-retrieval-fixtures.json`; it mixes verbatim real-job payloads,
incident probes, six deliberately disjoint-vocabulary paraphrases, and
self-retrieval sanity checks. Cases keep the original
`{agent, repo, instructions, expected_keys}` fields and add optional `id`,
`source`, `category`, `note`, and `expected_alternates`. An alternate ending in
`*` accepts any current key with that prefix, which keeps labels explicit across
lossless split-child key changes. Older fixture files still parse unchanged.

Every run reports K=5 and K=15 (plus a custom `--k` cutoff when it differs) and
preserves the original top-level metrics for the requested K. JSON output adds
`schema_version`, a SHA-256 `fixture_hash`, an active-corpus fingerprint
(`active_count` + `max_updated_at`), per-category metrics, per-case hits/misses,
and budget-at-risk keys that retrieval found but the configured injection token
budget would evict. Misses follow a deterministic read-only taxonomy:

- `stale_label`: no exact/alternate key is active;
- `scope_pool_exclusion`: the fact is active but outside the agent/repo pools;
- `vocabulary_mismatch`: the sanitized production MATCH query does not match the
  expected fact's own FTS row;
- `ranking_loss`: the row matches and is visible but ranks below K; the report
  includes its rank from a large-limit `PreviewEntries` probe.

The interpretation bands are recall@15 >= 0.8: keyword retrieval is adequate;
0.6-0.8: investigate ranking and budget; below 0.6: a separate embeddings trial
is justified. The command is measurement-only and opens the store read-only:

```sh
gitmoot memory eval --fixtures evals/memory-retrieval-fixtures.json --k 15 --json
```

Confirmed-memory injection reads the running agent's private pool unioned with
the reserved shared pool (`owner_kind=shared`, `owner_ref=shared`). BM25 relevance
still ranks first. On an equal BM25 score, the agent's private facts outrank
shared facts, then `updated_at DESC` breaks ties. A small floor guard keeps a
matching private fact from being completely starved by a tight limit full of
shared rows. After direct FTS hits are selected, prompt injection follows one
hop of persisted memory links in a single batched query. Linked facts must pass
the same owner, shared-pool, repo/general, and active-row visibility rules, rank
after all direct hits, and render with a `[linked]` tag. They fill only remaining
entry and token budget, so they never evict direct hits. Non-empty injected
blocks end with a footer reminding the agent that it can run
`gitmoot memory recall "<query>" --agent <agent-name>` for on-demand recall.
Semantic or embedding search is future work; current retrieval stays SQLite FTS5
plus persisted links. Entry into shared is always explicit and human-driven: use
`memory promote --to-shared`, `memory ingest --shared`, or
`memory confirm --to-shared`; daemon producers never auto-share facts.

`memory vault export` renders confirmed memory as a **disposable, Obsidian-compatible
vault view** (#737): one Markdown note per confirmed memory (sorted-key YAML
frontmatter + the content verbatim + a `## Links` section of FTS co-occurrence
and persisted `[[wikilinks]]`), a per-owner index note, and a `manifest.json`
staleness anchor.
It is a **view, not a replica**: the SQLite store stays the only source of truth,
so the vault is regenerated from scratch on every export, is safe to delete, and
is **deterministic** — the same store produces byte-identical files (there is no
`exported_at`; filenames are stable `NNNNNNNNN-<slug>.md` from the memory id).
Shared notes include an `author:` frontmatter line when `author_ref` is set, so
moving a fact into shared does not reattribute it to the shared pool. The
export is **read-only** (zero writes to any table) and writes to a temp dir then
atomically renames over `--out` (default: a `vault/` directory under the home's
evals area). `--agent NAME` narrows the export to one agent owner and shared
facts authored by that agent. Because the
export **replaces `--out` wholesale**, it refuses to overwrite a non-empty directory
that is not itself a prior gitmoot vault (one carrying a `manifest.json`) so an
accidental `--out ~/my-obsidian-vault` can never delete your own notes; pass
`--force` to override. This is P1 of the two-way memory bridge.

`memory vault import <DIR>` (#737 P2) is the **human curation gate** as an explicit
round-trip over the P1 export: you export a vault, edit/delete/add notes in Obsidian
(or any editor), then `import` **diffs the directory against a fresh export** and
applies only what you confirm. It first regenerates a fresh export in memory and
**aborts as stale** if the store changed since the vault was written (the manifest
`snapshot_hash` no longer matches), so a stale diff can never clobber newer facts.
Then, per note: an **edited** note updates its source memory's content (an
optimistic **CAS on `updated_at`** targets the exact row — never key-based — and
resyncs the FTS index); a **deleted** note **retires** its memory (additive
`retired_at`/`retired_reason` columns + FTS removal, so it stops being injected and
stops exporting — the audit row is preserved, never hard-deleted); a **new** `.md`
file with no `memory_id` stages a **pending observation** (`provenance=vault-import:<file>`,
trust `normal` — owner-authored) behind the existing confirmation gate. Frontmatter
identity edits (key/scope/owner) are **out of scope**: they are detected, warned,
and skipped (only the content edit applies). `--dry-run` is the **default** — it
prints the full diff and writes **nothing**; `--yes` applies edits, retirements, and
new observations in **one transaction** (all-or-nothing). If any note fails to parse
(e.g. broken YAML frontmatter), `--yes` **refuses to apply** — a malformed note could
otherwise be misread as a deletion and silently retire a live memory; fix the
frontmatter (or delete the file to intentionally retire it) and re-export. A vault
produced by `export --agent NAME` stays importable even when other owners have
memories (import rebuilds the fresh export with the manifest's recorded scope). The
`<DIR>` positional may appear before or after the flags.

### Markdown ingest, private auto-confirm, and provenance retirement (#737 P3, #782 V1)

`memory ingest` is the **mouth** of the bridge: it reads arbitrary Markdown
(session notes, runbooks, incident writeups) and stages it as observations behind
the existing confirmation gate. By default those observations stay pending. If
`[memory].ingest_auto_confirm = true`, `memory ingest`, `memory ingest sweep`,
and `chat remember` immediately confirm the staged observation into the
authoring agent's **private** pool only. They never auto-confirm into the shared
pool. Shared memory stays explicit through `memory confirm --to-shared` or
`memory promote --to-shared`.

```sh
gitmoot memory ingest <path|dir> --agent NAME [--shared] [--repo owner/repo] [--tier repo|general] [--dry-run] [--json]
gitmoot memory ingest sweep [--json]
gitmoot memory observations [--agent NAME] [--provenance-prefix P] [--json]
gitmoot memory confirm <obs-id>... | --provenance-prefix P [--agent NAME] [--to-shared] [--yes] [--json]
gitmoot memory retire --provenance-prefix P [--agent NAME] [--dry-run] [--yes] [--json]
gitmoot memory promote --to-shared <id>... [--json]
gitmoot memory links backfill [--dry-run] [--json]
gitmoot memory links list <id> [--json]
```

`memory ingest` walks `*.md` (recursively for a directory), strips a leading YAML
frontmatter block when present, skips MEMORY.md-style index files whose body is
only a Markdown link list to other `.md` notes, and — only when a file's body exceeds ~512
estimated tokens — chunks it on `## ` headings (smaller files stay one
observation); any section still over budget is sub-split on paragraph/line
boundaries so no chunk exceeds the token budget (an oversized memory would
otherwise be force-injected wholesale by the injection block). Every chunk passes
the same deterministic **PreFilter** as agent learnings (rejecting
directive-phrased, secret-shaped, executable, or — for `--tier general` —
non-repo-agnostic content), with a per-reason rejection count in the summary.
Chunks whose exact content already exists **in the same visibility domain** (same
scope and repo, as an observation or a confirmed row) are **deduped**, so
re-ingesting the same source inserts nothing — but the same note ingested under a
second repo still stages, since repo-scoped memory injects only for its own repo.
Surviving chunks land in `memory_observations` with `provenance = ingest:<relpath>`
and, crucially, **`trust_mark = low`** — see the trust note below. `--tier` defaults
to `repo`; `general` is only ever chosen with the explicit flag. `--shared`
stages the observations in the shared pool while preserving `--agent NAME` as
their author. With auto-confirm enabled, the confirmed write still goes to
`--agent NAME`'s private pool, not shared. `--dry-run` reports what would be
staged without writing.

Chunk keys are **stable**: `slug(file)-slug(heading)`, with an ordinal suffix
(`-2`, `-3`) only when a file/heading pair repeats within one sweep. The content
hash participates only in dedup, never in the key, so a re-swept **edited** note
lands on the same key as its earlier edition and, under auto-confirm, updates
the existing confirmed fact **in place**. Auto-confirmed key-matched updates
(ingest auto-confirm and `chat remember`) are **supersede-preserving**: the
prior edition is archived first as a `superseded_by` row (out of FTS, out of the
vault; `memory_links` stay on the unchanged live row id) so a bad edit never
destroys the last reviewed edition. Manual paths (vault import CAS edits,
`memory confirm --yes`) keep plain overwrite semantics. Keys minted before this
scheme end in an 8-hex content-hash suffix; the groom **rekey** detector
migrates them (below).

`memory ingest sweep` reads every configured `[[memory.ingest]]` source from the
current config at run time and runs the same ingest logic in-process for each one.
`--json` emits per-source entries with `path`, `agent`, `repo`, `tier`,
`inserted`, `confirmed`, `skipped_retired`, `deduped`, `rejected`, and `error`,
plus aggregate totals. One bad source does not stop the rest; the command exits
non-zero only when the config is invalid or every configured source fails. With
no sources it exits zero with a skipped note.

`memory observations` lists pending observations (optionally narrowed by
`--agent` or `--provenance-prefix`), flagging which keys already crossed the
confirm gate. `memory confirm` is the **human-gated promotion** step: it copies
selected observations (by id, or every observation matching a
`--provenance-prefix`) into confirmed memory, carrying provenance through.
Without `--yes` it prints the plan and writes nothing; with `--yes` it promotes
idempotently, re-confirming the same key upserts the one row. `--to-shared`
confirms selected observations into the shared pool and records the observation
author. `memory promote --to-shared <id>...` moves existing active confirmed
facts into shared, refuses retired or superseded rows, preserves outgoing
`memory_links`, and sets `author_ref` from the previous owner when needed. This is
**CLI-explicit only**.

`memory retire --provenance-prefix P` is the blast-radius undo for any collector
batch. It selects active confirmed rows whose provenance starts with `P`, scoped
optionally by `--agent NAME`, and is a dry run unless `--yes` is passed. Applying
the plan sets `retired_at` and `retired_reason` and removes the rows from FTS in
the same transaction, so they stop being injected and exported while the audit
rows remain. Retired keys are not resurrected by ingest or collectors on
re-ingest; only explicit human-controlled confirmation paths may revive a retired
key.

The built-in `memory-ingest-sweep` pipeline calls
`gitmoot memory ingest sweep --json` and then summarizes the run totals. Configure
sources under `[[memory.ingest]]`:

```toml
[[memory.ingest]]
path = "/path/to/markdown-notes"
agent = "lead"
repo = "owner/repo"
tier = "repo"
```

The daemon and `gitmoot pipeline install-defaults` register the pipeline
idempotently and skip an existing row named `memory-ingest-sweep`, preserving
local edits. The installed spec does not freeze the source list; changes to
`[[memory.ingest]]` apply on the next scheduled or manual run without reinstalling
defaults. Per-source errors are written into the run output, and the stage fails
visibly when the sweep command exits non-zero. With no sources, the pipeline
succeeds with a no-sources summary.
It is manual-only unless `[memory.pipelines].ingest_sweep` is set to a positive Go
duration such as `"24h"` or the alias `"nightly"`. A manual run is:

```sh
gitmoot pipeline run memory-ingest-sweep
```

Confirming a fact also writes up to three deterministic auto-links from that new
confirmed row to active related confirmed memories. The links are stored in the
`memory_links` side table with BM25-derived scores and never rewrite the fact
content. Link candidates use the same private-plus-shared visibility as injection,
so private facts can link to shared facts and shared facts can link back through
their author pool. `memory links backfill` applies the same link pass to the existing
active confirmed pool in id order; `--dry-run` reports the links it would create
without writing, and repeat runs are idempotent. `memory links list <id>` shows one fact's
persisted outgoing links. Vault export merges these persisted links with the
content-derived links in each note's `## Links` section and dedupes by target.

`memory log` reads the append-only SQLite brain changelog. The default feed is
newest-first and bounded to 50 events; key, agent, repository, kind, and duration
filters answer operational questions such as “what changed this week.” Valid
`--kind` values (unknown values are rejected): `created`, `updated`, `retired`,
`unretired`, `superseded`, `confirmed`, `promoted`, `ingested`,
`cluster_recompute`, `cluster_rename`.
`memory log --id <memory-id>` returns that fact's complete biography oldest-first.
`memory log backfill` synthesizes historical `created`, `retired`, and
`superseded` receipts from existing tombstones; `--dry-run` previews the work and
repeat runs do not duplicate events. Edit details retain the previous content
inline up to 2 KiB, then use a SHA-256 hash and 300-character preview.
The read-only dashboard API exposes the same feed at
`GET /api/brain/events?cursor=ID&limit=N`; its `total` is the exact append-only
event count. `GET /api/brain/fact?id=ID` returns the selected fact even when it
has been retired or superseded.

### Grooming: automatic brick splits + deterministic propose/apply (#737 P4.2, #832)

`memory groom` mechanizes the periodic curation pass that retires stale,
low-signal confirmed memories, as an explicit **propose → review → apply**
round-trip:

```sh
gitmoot memory groom --propose [--out PLAN.json] [--json]
gitmoot memory groom --yes --plan PLAN.json [--json]
gitmoot memory groom --split [--dry-run] [--json]
gitmoot memory groom --split-revert [--dry-run] [--parent N]... [--since RFC3339] [--json]
```

`--split` is the automatic, approval-free lossless pass. It partitions a brick
at byte offsets on strong story seams (bold story headers, date-led lines, and
PR markers). List items, `Why`, and `How to apply` sub-fields are never seams;
length alone never cuts, and status/changelog content is excluded. A candidate
needs at least two strong seams and two substantive children after repeatedly
merging trimmed segments smaller than 200 bytes into a neighbor. Children are
exact parent substrings in deterministic order and must concatenate to the
parent's trimmed coverage; any invariant failure falls back to a rewrite flag
without writing. Child keys use
`<parent-key>-<seam-slug>` with deterministic ordinals, provenance is
`groom-split:<parent-id>`, owner/author/repo/scope are inherited, and each child
renders with `(split from: <parent-key>)` subject context. Apply is one CAS-guarded
transaction: children and FTS rows are inserted, the parent leaves FTS and is set
`superseded_by = <first-child-id>`, and children replace the parent in its cluster.
Links are left for normal enrichment. `--dry-run` prints the same split plan
without changing the store; a repeat run is a no-op.

`--split-revert` restores all currently active groom-split parents by default;
repeat `--parent N` to select parent ids or pass `--since RFC3339` to select recent
splits. It first verifies that the active children in id order reconstruct the
trimmed parent exactly. A mismatched parent is skipped whole. Valid children are
retired with reason `groom-split-revert:<parent-id>` and removed from clusters,
the parent is restored to FTS, and its cluster is restored from the lowest-id
child's current cluster when available. The operation is idempotent, and
`--dry-run` lists the same groups without writing.

`--propose` reads every **active** confirmed memory (retired rows excluded),
computes the current vault `snapshot_hash` (the same anchor `vault export`/`import`
use), runs deterministic detectors, and writes a reviewable plan artifact
(`{schema_version, snapshot_hash, proposed_retirements, rewrite_flags, rekeys,
cross_pool, quality, stale, stats}`). It never changes confirmed memories;
quality and enabled staleness passes may add immutable verdict-cache rows. The
detectors are:

- **status/changelog/ToC snapshots** — notes dominated (≥80% of non-blank lines) by
  `STATUS:` markers, `SHIPPED`/`merged & deployed` changelog phrases, ISO-date-led
  lines, or Markdown link-list (`- [ …]`) index entries. Short notes (fewer than 3
  non-blank lines) additionally require a **strong** marker (`STATUS:`/`… & deployed`),
  so a single high-value fact that merely leads with a date or mentions `SHIPPED`
  once is **kept**, not retired;
- **bare to-do lists** — content whose every non-blank line is a `- [ ]`/`- [x]`
  checkbox;
- **exact duplicates** — memories with identical content **in the same
  owner/repo/scope**; the lowest id is kept and the rest proposed for retirement. A
  fact duplicated across owners, repos, or scopes is **not** deduped — each copy is
  the only one visible in its own retrieval scope (owner/repo/scope is shown on each
  proposed retirement so you can tell them apart);
- **brick rewrite flags** include over-long content (> ~1200 chars) and
  under-threshold multi-story content with at least two strong seams. The
  automatic lossless `--split` pass handles qualifying bricks; seam-poor long
  prose remains flag-only for a later LLM atomizer;
- **legacy-key rekeys** (#804): active rows whose key still ends in the
  pre-stable-key 8-hex content-hash suffix (`…-a1b2c3d4`) are grouped per
  owner/repo/scope by their stripped stable key. Organic sweeps can never fix
  them (content dedup skips unchanged notes; the first edit would spawn a
  stable-keyed third sibling), so the plan keeps the current edition (the row
  already holding the stable key when one exists, otherwise the newest by
  `updated_at`), rewrites its key to the stable form, and retires the older
  siblings with reason `rekey: superseded edition`;
- **cross-pool stale shared editions** (#804): a shared-pool fact gets a
  **promote-and-retire pair** when a strictly newer private fact matches it in
  the same repo and scope, by stable-key equality (primary, deterministic) or
  by a strong BM25 top-match that also shares a `memory_links` edge (composite
  secondary evidence; BM25 alone never proposes). Applying promotes the newer
  private edition to the shared pool (author preserved) and retires the stale
  shared edition with reason `cross-pool: superseded by promoted edition`.
- **general quality risk** (#888): facts younger than `groom_quality_min_age`
  (default `24h`) are excluded. Older facts score +3 for transient
  status/source-controlled history, +3 for fragments, +3 for generic content
  without specifics, +2 for near-duplicates, +1 for automated provenance, and
  +1 below 160 characters. Lesson shape (`**Why:**`, `**How to apply:**`, or a
  concrete cause-to-consequence statement) subtracts 3 and is explicitly
  protected from candidacy. The audit threshold is 3.
- **expired operational-status batons** (#854): the default-on `groom_stale`
  detector requires an uppercase `AWAITING`, `PENDING`, `SUBMITTED`, `IN FLIGHT`,
  `CANCELLED`, or check-status verb in a `##`/`STATUS:` header, tracker-id or
  dated-header corroboration, and a newest in-content ISO date older than
  `groom_stale_age` (default `336h`, 14 days). `**Why:**` and
  `**How to apply:**` lessons and status/changelog-routed notes are excluded.

Quality candidates use the split runtime/model knobs and an immutable SHA-256
cache. The strict verdict is `useless`, `useful`, or
`contains_durable_residue`, with confidence in `[0,1]`; residue must be an exact
content quote. Auto-retirement requires both `useless` and at least two
independent positive signal families. Residue stays an owner-gated extraction
proposal and every delivery, parse, validation, or cache error fails closed.
With default `groom_quality = false`, the pass still runs in `--propose` and
`--split`, but the plan's `quality` section is marked `shadow: true` and reports
`would_retire` without mutation. Enabling the knob lets `--split` use the
reversible house path with reason `groom-quality:<date>`.

Stale candidates use the existing `groom_split_llm_runtime`,
`groom_split_llm_model`, and `groom_split_llm_max_per_run` settings. The strict
verdict is `expired`, `still_relevant`, or `contains_durable_residue`; residue
must be an exact content quote. Verdicts have a separate SHA-256 content cache.
Plan `stale` entries report the candidate, verdict, action, cache hit, residue,
and fail-closed fallback reason. Residue, disabled delivery, malformed output,
and runtime failures remain owner-gated proposals.

Stale retirement is audit-preserving and reversible: the confirmed row remains
in SQLite with its content intact. An owner restoring one must clear that row's
`retired_at` and `retired_reason` and reinsert its `(rowid, content, key)` into
`confirmed_memories_fts` in the same transaction; clearing only the retirement
fields does not make the memory searchable or injectable again.

`--yes --plan` recomputes the `snapshot_hash` and **aborts as stale** if it differs
from the plan's (a vault edit between propose and apply invalidates it), then
applies the whole plan in **one transaction**: retirements (reason
`groom:<detector>`, FTS index cleared in the same tx), rekey groups (FTS key
column re-synced in the same tx), and cross-pool pairs. **No content is edited or
rewritten**, and applying is idempotent: an already-retired or missing id is
skipped gracefully, and a rekey group or cross-pool pair whose rows changed state
since the proposal is skipped whole rather than half-applied.

The built-in `memory-groom-propose` pipeline first auto-runs
`gitmoot memory groom --split --json`, then runs the proposal half with
`gitmoot memory groom --propose --out <run-scoped-plan> --json` and summarizes
both counts. Lossless splits auto-apply. The same `--split` run auto-retires a
stale candidate only when both deterministic shape and a cached or fresh
`expired` verdict agree, using reason `groom-stale:<date>` and clearing FTS. With
quality enabled, the same run retires only `useless` facts corroborated by at
least two signal families. Quality, stale, and split calls share
`groom_llm_total_max_per_run` (default 10); individual caps cannot stack past it.
Ordinary retirement, rekey, cross-pool, residue, and fail-closed stale proposals
remain owner-gated. The daemon
and `gitmoot pipeline install-defaults` register it idempotently and skip an
existing row named `memory-groom-propose`, preserving local edits. It is
manual-only unless `[memory.pipelines].groom_propose` is set:

```toml
[memory.pipelines]
repo = "owner/repo"
ingest_sweep = "nightly"
groom_propose = "nightly"
```

`[memory].groom_split_llm = false` is the LLM split and stale-delivery gate. The
quality classifier still runs in shadow mode and uses the configured
runtime/model. When split LLM is enabled, `memory groom --split` sends only
over-threshold bricks left unsplit by the
deterministic pass to isolated one-shot runtime sessions. The host supplies a
closed menu of blank-line/strong-seam boundaries outside lists and fenced code;
the model can only choose menu ids or keep the brick. Gitmoot validates strict
JSON plus exact echoed lines, maps ids back to host byte offsets, and runs the
same runt merge, substantive-child, coverage, store re-check, and CAS path as
deterministic splits. The model never rewrites content.

`groom_split_llm_runtime` defaults to `codex` (`codex`, `claude`, or `kimi`),
`groom_split_llm_model = ""` uses that runtime's default model, and
`groom_split_llm_max_per_run = 5` caps split/stale calls while
`groom_quality_max_per_run = 8` caps quality calls. Bricks over 8192 bytes are
reported and skipped, never truncated. Valid split and no-split verdicts are
cached by SHA-256 of trimmed content, so unchanged bricks are not billed again;
cached split cuts are revalidated through the full lossless tail. The existing
pipeline artifact `groom-split.json` includes per-brick decision, cut ids, model,
cache status, and any fail-closed fallback reason.

```sh
gitmoot pipeline run memory-groom-propose
```

### memory clusters (#763, #779)

`memory clusters` surfaces **emergent memory clusters**: communities detected over
the fact-similarity graph, the **same** bm25 + id-tiebreak signal the vault
`[[links]]` use. They replace the old fixed key-prefix "category" hubs on the
dashboard Knowledge view: clusters are discovered from what the facts actually say,
not from how their keys happen to be namespaced.

```sh
gitmoot memory clusters [--json]
gitmoot memory clusters recompute --propose [--out PLAN.json] [--json]
gitmoot memory clusters recompute --apply [--plan PLAN.json] [--json]
gitmoot memory cluster rename <cluster-id> <label>
```

- `memory clusters` lists the hierarchy with child clusters indented. Every row
  includes its display label (the owner override when set, else the computed
  label), member count, and medoid fact id. A split parent's count is the sum of
  its leaf children. The reserved cluster **0 `unclustered`** holds facts with no
  similarity neighbors.
- **Determinism is guaranteed.** The community detection is **id-ordered label
  propagation** with **lowest-label tie-breaks** over a fixed graph: node visit
  order is the sorted fact ids, initial labels are the ids themselves, neighbor
  influence is a weight *sum* (order-independent), and every tie resolves to the
  lowest label. There is no map-iteration order, randomness, or wall-clock input
  anywhere, so the **same store always yields byte-identical clusters, labels,
  medoids, cluster ids, and hierarchy**, matching the vault byte-identity house rule.
- **Labels** are up to three **distinctive terms**, ranked by term frequency inside
  the cluster weighted against corpus document frequency (frequent-inside-yet-
  rare-across-clusters wins), joined with `-` and anchored to the **medoid** fact
  for stability. The **medoid** is the member with the highest total intra-cluster
  similarity (lowest id breaks ties). Child labels use tf-idf across their siblings,
  so they describe what distinguishes each child inside its parent.
- **Automatic hierarchy:** during recompute, a top-level cluster with at least 20
  facts is clustered again on its internal subgraph. A split is accepted only when
  it produces at least two children and every child has at least four facts. The
  maximum depth is two levels. Existing splits remain while the parent has more
  than 12 facts and every recomputed child still has at least four; otherwise the
  split dissolves. Facts always attach to leaf clusters.
- **`recompute`** is a human-gated **propose → review → apply** round-trip, mirroring
  `memory groom`. `--propose` rebuilds the clustering and writes a reviewable plan
  (`{schema_version, anchor, clusters, moves, new_facts, dropped_facts, splits,
  dissolves, stats}`) showing fact moves and automatic hierarchy changes without
  touching the store. `--apply --plan` recomputes
  the **staleness anchor** (a hash over every active fact's `(id, updated_at)`),
  **aborts as stale** if the store changed since the proposal, then writes the whole
  clustering in **one transaction**. **First run:** when no clusters exist yet there
  is nothing to protect, so `recompute --apply` (no `--plan`) is allowed and builds
  them directly.
- **Incremental attach:** confirming a **new** fact (`memory confirm`) best-effort
  attaches it to the leaf cluster of its nearest similarity neighbor (or the
  `unclustered` bucket) without a full recompute; the attach never blocks a
  confirmation. Nothing is ever re-shelved silently; wholesale re-clustering is the explicit
  `recompute` proposal.
- `memory cluster rename` sets an **owner label override** that wins over the
  computed label. A parent override survives a later split. A child override survives
  while its stable child id persists and is removed when that split dissolves. The
  reserved `unclustered` bucket cannot be renamed.

The Knowledge payload adds `parent_id` to child cluster entries. Facts continue to
carry leaf cluster ids, while parent hubs remain an aggregate view only.

## Pipelines

A pipeline (#681) runs a **declared DAG of shell and managed-agent stages** — a
fixed, repeatable multi-step flow — on demand, on an interval schedule, or after
another pipeline succeeds. Each
stage is an ordinary queued job: shell commands use the shell runtime, while agent
stages use their registered runtime. The normal worker tick claims and runs it,
and a scan-based advancer folds each stage's `gitmoot_result` **decision**
and enqueues the stages whose `needs` have all succeeded. Pipelines reuse the job
queue, the result contract, and the heartbeat scheduling idiom (durable `next_due`,
overlap guard, missed-ticks-coalesce). They are **off by default** (no pipelines ⇒
the daemon's pipeline scan returns before touching state).

Define a pipeline in a YAML file and register it:

```yaml
name: nightly-sync          # required, name-safe token (letters, digits, - _)
repo: owner/repo            # optional to register; REQUIRED to run
env_file: /root/.config/nightly-sync/env # optional 0600 secret file
env:                         # optional inline NON-secret defaults
  OUTPUT_DIR: /srv/nightly-sync
schedule:                   # optional interval schedule (no cron in v1)
  interval: 24h             #   positive Go duration (required with a schedule block)
  jitter: 15m               #   optional random [0, jitter] added to next_due
trigger:                    # optional event source (email or pipeline)
  kind: email
  connection: gmail-imap    #   default gmail-imap
  mailbox: INBOX            #   default INBOX
  map:                      #   optional output name -> closed email selector
    subject: subject
    sender: from_address
stages:                     # the DAG, keyed by unique id and wired by needs
  - id: source
    cmd: "curl -sf https://example.com/data > data.json"
    env_keys: [SOURCE_API_TOKEN]
  - id: score
    cmd: "python score.py data.json"
    isolate: true          # optional shell-only detached read-only worktree
    needs: [source]         # runs only after every listed stage SUCCEEDS
  - id: triage              # an AGENT stage instead of a shell cmd (exactly one of cmd|agent|gate)
    agent: reply-triager    #   #757 read-only leaf
    action: ask             #   ask (default) | review | implement (+ write: true, #768)
    prompt: "Triage the scored data; block if a human is needed."
    needs: [score]          #   upstream results are prepended to the prompt
  # other agent-stage kinds:
  #   implement (#768): action: implement + write: true → mutates repo + opens a PR
  #   bound review (#813): action: review + source: <impl stage> -> reviews that PR/head, report-only
  #   orchestrate (#758): orchestrate: true → sub-tree coordinator (fans out owned children, folds synthesis)
  #   gate (#768): gate: pr_merged + source: <impl stage> (no agent) → jobless; human merge is default
  #   auto-merge gate: add merge: auto plus top-level allow_auto_merge: true; requires source-bound review
  - id: deploy
    cmd: "rclone copy out/ r2:bucket"
    needs: [triage]
    timeout: 30m            # optional per-stage job timeout
    retry: 2                # optional; re-attempt a FAILED stage up to N times
```

To start this pipeline once for every newly-succeeded run of another pipeline,
use the alternative pipeline trigger shape (do not combine it with `schedule`):

```yaml
trigger:
  kind: pipeline
  pipeline: upstream-name
```

```sh
gitmoot pipeline add nightly-sync.yaml --enable   # validate + store; omit --enable to add disabled
gitmoot pipeline export nightly-sync --output ./nightly-sync.bundle
gitmoot pipeline import ./nightly-sync.bundle --repo new-owner/new-repo
gitmoot pipeline remote set owner/pipeline-catalog
gitmoot pipeline remote show
gitmoot pipeline publish nightly-sync [--remote owner/pipeline-catalog] [--create]
gitmoot pipeline pull --list [--remote owner/pipeline-catalog]
gitmoot pipeline pull nightly-sync [--remote owner/pipeline-catalog] --repo new-owner/new-repo [--agent-map exported=local]
gitmoot pipeline install-defaults                 # install built-in memory pipelines, skipping existing names
gitmoot pipeline list [--json]
gitmoot pipeline show nightly-sync [--json]        # registry view for a name
gitmoot pipeline bind-trigger nightly-sync         # create/re-sync owned AP flow
gitmoot pipeline run nightly-sync [--payload key=value ...] [--payload-json '<obj>']
gitmoot pipeline watch <run-id> [--timeout 10m] [--poll 5s] [--json]
gitmoot pipeline show <run-id> [--json]            # run funnel for a "prun-…" id
gitmoot pipeline expose --schema schema.json <name> # issue one bearer token (shown once)
gitmoot pipeline serve                              # loopback API on 127.0.0.1:8792
gitmoot pipeline resume <run-id> [--from <stage>]
gitmoot pipeline cancel <run-id>
gitmoot pipeline enable|disable nightly-sync
gitmoot pipeline remove nightly-sync
```

### Expose a shell pipeline as a service

Service exposure is explicit and v1 accepts only shell-only, template-free
pipelines. Define a bounded flat schema, expose the pipeline, then run the
separate authenticated listener:

```json
{"version":1,"fields":{"count":{"type":"integer","required":true,"minimum":1,"maximum":5}}}
```

```sh
gitmoot pipeline expose --schema schema.json nightly-sync
gitmoot pipeline serve # --addr defaults to 127.0.0.1:8792
```

The exposure command stores only the SHA-256 token digest and prints the
base64url bearer token once. `--disable` blocks new POSTs but does **not** revoke
read/poll access to already accepted runs; use `--rotate-token` to revoke the old
bearer credential. The API accepts
`POST /v1/pipelines/<name>/runs` and exposes authenticated status/bundle reads at
`/v1/pipelines/runs/<id>`. Inputs are schema-validated and delivered only as
reserved `GITMOOT_INPUT_*` environment variables, never prompt text. Admission
is atomic (rate bucket, global cap, per-pipeline overlap, run/stages/receipt),
uses unpredictable 128-bit run ids, and every service shell stage runs in a
fail-closed detached worktree. Service exposure rejects any stage that declares
`env_keys`, network access, or extra read/write authority.

Successful service shell stages may deliver files beneath `out/`. Gitmoot
collects them before disposing the detached worktree, namespaces them as
`artifacts/<stage-id>/...`, and caps the run at 64 MiB total; exceeding the cap
fails finalization instead of truncating output. On the first authenticated GET
after success, Gitmoot freezes an archive with those files, the accepted #941
bundle, `proof.json`, and `verification.json`. Per-file size and SHA-256 metadata
is committed by artifact nodes in the offline proof.

The public, read-only `/receipts/<id>` page lists artifact names, sizes, and
digests, but its sanitized `/receipts/<id>/bundle` omits artifact bytes. Only the
authenticated `/v1/pipelines/runs/<id>/bundle` delivers the files. Neither
surface discloses bearer tokens, inputs, prompts, logs, or raw result text. Both
bundles intentionally include the frozen pipeline spec with its full shell
command bodies and referenced environment-variable names. Never inline a secret
literal in `cmd`; an `env_keys`-bearing pipeline cannot be exposed at all. Public
capability receipt URLs remain public after token rotation. Use `--allow-remote`
only behind owner-controlled TLS/firewall policy.

### Export and import a pipeline bundle

`pipeline export <name> --output <dir>` creates a portable directory, never a
single YAML blob:

```text
nightly-sync.bundle/
├── bundle.yaml          # version, requirements, warnings, agents, spec hash
├── spec.yaml            # stored bytes with only repo replaced by __GITMOOT_REPO__
└── templates/
    └── reply-triager.md # canonical agenttemplate.Export snapshot
```

The exporter carries YAML comments and ordering through unchanged, reports
host-specific `/root`, `/home`, `/Users`, and `/tmp` paths found in command
stages, and warns that template prompts travel verbatim. It exports connection
names as requirements, but never trigger-binding state, tokens, connection
credentials, or environment values from local Gitmoot/Activepieces state.

Import on another machine with its real repository and any local agent mapping:

```sh
gitmoot pipeline import ./nightly-sync.bundle \
  --repo new-owner/new-repo \
  --name nightly-sync-copy \
  --agent-map reply-triager=local-triager
```

Every import prints a requirements report first: available/missing runtimes,
named Activepieces connections when they can be checked, present/missing upstream
pipelines, write-authority flags that need consent, and absolute-path warnings.
Without `--agent-map`, embedded templates are installed and their declared agents
are registered. Existing templates, agents, or pipeline names with different
content are refused unless `--force`; identical content is a no-op. A missing
runtime for an unmapped agent is a hard failure.

Imported pipelines land **disabled**, even when replacing an enabled row. Review
the report and stored spec, then run `pipeline enable <name>` or pass `--enable`
to the import to explicitly re-consent any `allow_scheduled_writes`,
`allow_triggered_writes`, or `allow_auto_merge` authority. The target repo and an
optional new name are injected without re-marshaling the rest of the YAML. The
stored `spec_hash` therefore hashes the imported bytes and correctly differs from
the source bundle whenever repo/name/agent mappings changed. Missing upstream
pipelines are allowed and leave the imported pipeline dormant until they exist.

### Share a pipeline via GitHub

Configure one GitHub repository as the default catalog, publish from the source
home, then list and pull from another home:

```sh
# Source home. --create creates owner/pipeline-catalog as a PRIVATE repo.
gitmoot pipeline remote set owner/pipeline-catalog
gitmoot pipeline publish nightly-sync --create

# Target home.
gitmoot pipeline remote set owner/pipeline-catalog
gitmoot pipeline pull --list
gitmoot pipeline pull nightly-sync \
  --repo new-owner/new-repo \
  --agent-map reply-triager=local-triager
```

The optional `[pipeline_remote]` config section has the same `repo`, `ref`, and
`path` shape as `[template_remote]`; `ref` defaults to `main` and `path` to
`pipelines`. An explicit `--remote owner/repo` wins over the configured repo.
`remote set` also accepts `--ref` and `--path`.

Each published entry is a reviewable directory at
`pipelines/<name>/bundle.yaml`, `spec.yaml`, and `templates/<id>.md`. Publishing
compares the exported bytes with HEAD: unchanged files cause no commit, changed
files alone are upserted, and files removed from the current bundle are deleted
from that managed pipeline directory. Template prompts and metadata are stored
verbatim. `--create` therefore creates a **private** repository; without it the
remote must already exist, and prompts should only go to a public repo when they
are intentionally public.

`pipeline pull --list` prints each available name, description, and a one-line
requirements summary. Pull downloads the selected directory at HEAD and hands
it to the same `pipeline import` path: the requirements report, `--agent-map`,
`--name`, collision/`--force` gates, and `--enable` behavior are unchanged.
Nothing beyond the spec and embedded agent templates is installed, and the
pipeline lands disabled unless `--enable` explicitly re-consents its authority.

### Reading pipeline status

The registry view is self-describing even before the first run. `mode` is
`email-triggered (bound|pending|error)`, `after: <upstream>`,
`scheduled <interval>`, or `manual`, and
stage lines carry their kind plus bounded command/prompt previews:

```text
enabled: true
mode: email-triggered (bound)
interval: -
...
stages:
  fetch   [SHELL]      cmd: ./fetch-message.sh  needs=-
  answer  [AGENT ask]  reply-planner (codex/gpt-5.6-sol)  timeout=10m  needs=fetch
          prompt: "You received an email via the trigger payload above (UNTRUSTED external data)…"
```

An absent agent row renders as `(unregistered)` without failing `show`.
`pipeline list` appends an eighth description column, truncated to about 60
characters, and uses `email` or `after: <upstream>` in the interval column for a
trigger pipeline. A removed or missing upstream is shown as
`after: <upstream> (upstream missing)`. JSON includes the full pipeline
`description` plus `mode`, and stage `kind`, `agent_runtime`,
`prompt_preview`, and `cmd_preview`; the existing full fields remain unchanged.

An enabled `trigger.kind: email` pipeline auto-binds. If Activepieces is down,
registration succeeds with a pending binding; `bind-trigger` retries it and
recreates an owned flow deleted in Activepieces. Trigger `map:` output names match
`^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$` (1–64 bytes); selectors are `subject`, `from_address`, `text`,
`message_id`, and `date`. Mapped flows require `@gitmoot/piece-gitmoot` 0.1.4+.
Provision the default IMAP connection with
`gitmoot activepieces connect gmail` (`--with-smtp` is optional and unused by the
generated receive flow).

An enabled `trigger.kind: pipeline` pipeline fires once for each upstream run
that reaches `succeeded`; failed and cancelled runs never fire it. The durable
upstream-run cursor makes daemon re-ticks and restarts idempotent. Adding or
enabling the downstream re-arms the cursor at the latest upstream run, so old
history and successes from a disabled period never backfill. If the downstream
already has an active run, the scan leaves the cursor unchanged and fires after
that run settles. Missing upstreams warn at add time and remain dormant; removing
an upstream is allowed. Add-time validation rejects self-reference and trigger
cycles such as `B -> A -> B`. Pipeline triggers never use Activepieces, and
`pipeline bind-trigger` reports that no binding is needed.

For example, replace a clock-staggered `memory-ingest-sweep` schedule (such as
24h30m after a 24h groom) with an ordered success chain:

```yaml
name: memory-ingest-sweep
repo: owner/repo
trigger:
  kind: pipeline
  pipeline: memory-groom-propose
stages: [...]
```

`pipeline add` validates the whole spec at add time (unknown keys, duplicate/self/
cyclic `needs`, self/cyclic pipeline triggers, a schedule+pipeline-trigger hybrid,
a stage that is not exactly one of `cmd`/`agent`/`gate`, an agent stage
missing a `prompt` / invalid `action` / `implement` without `write: true` / a mutating
stage on a scheduled pipeline without `allow_scheduled_writes` / a mutating stage on
a triggered pipeline without `allow_triggered_writes` / a gate or review's
bad `source` / `source` on another stage kind / `isolate: true` on a non-shell
stage, invalid durations, a `success_decisions` outside
`approved`/`implemented`/`changes_requested`/`skipped`) so a mistake is a clear error, not a
stuck run. It stores the raw YAML **verbatim** plus a content hash; each run
snapshots that hash and executes its snapshot, so editing the file later never
mutates an in-flight run. `pipeline add` also auto-creates one hidden shell runner
agent (`pipeline-<name>-runner`) that owns the **shell** stage jobs — filtered out of
`agent list` and disposed by `pipeline remove`. An **agent stage** (#757) instead
runs a named managed agent on its own runtime as a read-only leaf (`ask`/`review`);
its `needs` stages' result summaries are prepended to the prompt, and a repo-bound
agent stage runs in its own detached read-only worktree so same-repo agent stages
parallelize without touching the live checkout.

A shell stage may set `isolate: true` to opt into a disposable detached read-only
worktree at the managed checkout's committed tip. The default remains the shared
checkout, including its uncommitted/gitignored data and any intentional writes.
Opt-in allocation is fail-open: failure emits `readonly_worktree_skipped` and runs
on the shared checkout. On success the command receives
`GITMOOT_CHECKOUT=<live-checkout>` for cwd-independent access to data omitted from
the clean worktree. This removes checkout-lock serialization, and each isolated stage
also takes a job-scoped shell runtime-session key (`runtime:shell:job:<hash(job)>`)
instead of the command-hash key, so same-repo stages run concurrently even when they
share the identical command (#1034). Service shell stages retain their unconditional,
fail-closed isolation; agent and gate stages reject this shell-only field.

Shell and agent stages can opt into scoped key access with `env_keys`. Source
files must be absolute, operator-owned regular files
with mode exactly `0600`, outside the Gitmoot home and every managed checkout;
inline `env` is for non-secret defaults. A shell stage with no list gets
nothing. Its resolution is own
`env_file`, then a shared `injected` or configured `proxied` key granted with
`gitmoot key grant`, then inline default. Registered but ungranted names do not
match exact or glob selectors. Structural errors always fail add; unresolved
names warn only while the pipeline remains disabled, then hard-fail
add-with-enable, enable, manual run, and scheduled/triggered preflight.

Agent stages resolve only configured `proxied` registry keys granted to their
registered seat. The seat grant and the stage selector are both required;
injected agent grants, pipeline files/defaults/grants, and gate-stage selectors
are refused. Ordinary agent jobs receive no keys, and delegation children do
not inherit the parent stage's key access.

Sources are revalidated and reread at delivery, so rotation applies without a
daemon restart. Each payload audits `PipelineName` and names-only
`PipelineKeyAccess` rows `{stage,name,source,mode}`; `pipeline show --json`
exposes the same projection. A shared grant is rechecked immediately before
delivery: revocation fails closed and never switches to another source. Gitmoot
internal `GITMOOT_*` entries remain final. Injected mode exposes the value to
that shell process. Proxied mode puts a per-job placeholder in `<KEY>` and a
loopback endpoint in `GITMOOT_PROXY_<KEY>_URL`; every request rereads the value,
rechecks the pipeline or agent-seat grant, and is constrained to the configured
upstream/base path. For agent stages the real value never enters the process,
but the authorized agent can exercise it against that pinned upstream.
The lease is revoked when delivery ends.

Proxied mode hides key bytes; it does **not** prevent an authorized child from
exercising the credential on the pinned upstream. Curated upstreams and base
paths are part of the model. Configure only trusted upstreams. Pipeline key
delivery stays separate from the Claude model gateway.

For a non-empty run payload, every agent stage (including roots) receives a
dynamically fenced, 6000-byte-bounded `UNTRUSTED external data` block before
upstream context; each rendered value is capped at 1500 bytes. Shell stages receive
exact `GITMOOT_TRIGGER_<UPPERCASE_KEY>` exec environment entries, never shell-source
interpolation. The full canonical payload is retained in the SQLite run row and
shown as redacted/truncated key provenance by text `pipeline show <run-id>` and
as `payload_json` in JSON; job env/prompt projections follow normal job-data
retention.

Every pipeline shell stage also receives `GITMOOT_PIPELINE_NAME`,
`GITMOOT_PIPELINE_RUN_ID`, and `GITMOOT_PIPELINE_STAGE_ID`. A dependent shell
stage receives `GITMOOT_PIPELINE_UPSTREAM_CONTEXT_FILE`, naming a delivery-scoped
`0600` JSON tempfile with v1 `schema_version`, `complete`, and a `stages` map of
settled state/summary records. Each summary's marshaled JSON string is capped at
16 KiB with rune-safe truncation, and the final marshaled file at 64 KiB;
`complete:false` or `summary_truncated:true`
signals partial data. The content is persisted and re-created at a fresh path for
retries; the file is removed after delivery. Treat summaries as untrusted data,
never shell source, and keep credentials out of them. A strict consumer can start
with `jq -e '.schema_version == 1 and .complete == true' "$GITMOOT_PIPELINE_UPSTREAM_CONTEXT_FILE"`.
A successfully isolated non-service shell stage additionally receives
`GITMOOT_CHECKOUT`, a best-effort path to the live managed checkout for reading
gitignored `repos/**` or uncommitted data. Prefer the stage cwd for committed files.
Treat this path as read-only, and do not run the isolated reader beside a default
stage that mutates the checkout: those live reads can observe a torn tree or
`index.lock` contention. The input, trigger, metadata, keycard, and upstream-context
variables are unchanged by the detached cwd.

`action: produce` (#814/#825) is a sandboxed pipeline leaf for writing operator-owned
data, never repo/branch/task/PR state. Codex uses its native sandbox; Claude and
modern Kimi require a successful `gitmoot sandbox probe` and are re-execed under
strict Landlock. Non-Linux/unsupported hosts keep the Codex-only refusal. It requires
`write: true`, one or more absolute
cleaned `writes:` paths, a `produce`-capable writable agent, and optionally
`network: true`, `check: <cmd>`, and `check_retries: N`. `pipeline add` resolves
symlinks and rejects targets overlapping `/`, the Gitmoot home, or a managed checkout.
The worker repeats that same canonicalization immediately before delivery to close
symlink-retargeting races. Declared paths are additive `--add-dir` grants. For
Claude/Kimi, Landlock limits writes to those existing directories plus the workdir,
temp roots, standard device nodes, and runtime-owned state: `$HOME/.claude` plus
`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/claude-cli-nodejs` for Claude, and `$HOME/.kimi-code` for Kimi.
Gitmoot sets `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=$HOME/.claude` so Claude's mutable config stays inside
that state grant. Apart from runtime state/cache and device nodes, declared data paths,
the disposable workdir, and temp roots are the only writable locations. Codex behavior
is unchanged. Landlock does not govern network access.
A Codex danger-full-access agent receives no add-dir/network arguments because it is
already unrestricted. Checks re-ask the same session with
redacted/capped output; stage retries must reconcile partial data idempotently.
Gitmoot cleans only the disposable cwd, never the declared data directories.

An `action: review` stage may set `source: <implement-stage>` (also listed in its
`needs`) to bind to that implement job's structured PR stamp. The review payload
inherits the PR number, head SHA, branch, task, and lead agent; its detached worktree
is pinned to the exact PR head. The verdict still posts as a PR comment and folds by
`success_decisions`, but pipeline reviews are report-only: they dispatch no native
fix job and never run the native merge gate. Declaring this review also sets
`SkipNativeReviewFanout` on the source implement request, avoiding duplicate native
reviewer jobs. If the source permanently produces no PR (no-op or `skipped`), the
review folds blocked immediately with `source stage produced no PR; nothing to
review` and no unbound review is dispatched.

The `pr_merged` gate remains a human-merge waiter by default. Opt-in
`merge: auto` is gate-only and also requires top-level `allow_auto_merge: true`
plus at least one review stage bound to the same implement source. The advancer,
not the report-only review job, performs one squash attempt only after every bound
review folded `approved`, the live PR head still equals the reviewed payload
`HeadSHA`, GitHub reports mergeable, and checks pass. Pending checks keep waiting;
head drift, conflicts/unmergeability, or a merge API error fold the gate blocked.
Merge errors are not retried. Scheduled pipelines need both `allow_auto_merge` and
the existing `allow_scheduled_writes` key. Omitting `merge` preserves human merge.
Pending checks wait; skipped/neutral check-runs pass; failures block; and zero
external statuses/checks always block regardless of `require_external_ci`. The
source job atomically records `pipeline_auto_merge_claim` before the write and
`pipeline_auto_merge_confirmed` after GitHub confirms it.

`pipeline install-defaults` installs the built-in memory pipelines
`memory-ingest-sweep` and `memory-groom-propose`. The daemon also runs this
installer at startup. Installation is idempotent: if either pipeline name already
exists, Gitmoot skips it and does not overwrite the stored YAML, hash, enabled
flag, or schedule. Empty memory pipeline config still installs manual-only
definitions, but they are inert until a manual run or an enabled interval
schedule. Configure sources with `[[memory.ingest]]` and schedules with
`[memory.pipelines]`; see the memory section above.

A stage signals its outcome by printing a `gitmoot_result` blob to stdout; the
advancer folds by the **decision**, never the job's exit state (`changes_requested`
is a succeeded job but folds as a stage **failure** by default — a stage folds on the
decision, not the job state):

```sh
printf '%s' '{"gitmoot_result":{"decision":"approved","summary":"synced"}}'
printf '%s' '{"gitmoot_result":{"decision":"blocked","summary":"secret missing","needs":["R2 token"]}}'
```

- a decision in the stage's `success_decisions` (default `approved`/`implemented`/`skipped`) ->
  **succeeded**, dependents enqueue;
- `blocked` → the stage blocks, its `needs` persist at the stage **and** run level,
  the run **parks blocked** (downstream never enqueues, zero compute while parked);
- `failed` / any other decision / a cancelled job / no `gitmoot_result` → the stage
  **fails** (retried if budget remains), else the run **parks failed**.

`skipped` means the stage itself had no work and advances by default with a
`[skipped: no work]` summary marker. An explicit `success_decisions` list is
strict: omitting `skipped` makes it fail. A `pr_merged` gate whose source skipped
parks blocked because no PR can exist for that run.

`pipeline run` prints only the run id (script-stable: `RUN=$(gitmoot pipeline run
nightly-sync)`); repeat `--payload key=value` or use one `--payload-json` string
object to enter the existing trigger-input seam. The forms are mutually exclusive
and share the bridge's key/count/size validation. A manual run ignores `enabled` but still needs a `repo` and refuses
to start while a run is already active. `pipeline show <run-id>` renders the **text
funnel** (`source OK -> score BLOCKED (needs: R2 token) -> deploy SKIPPED`) under a
run header; a **failed** run also prints the exact `gitmoot report bug --job
<stage-job>` command (gitmoot never auto-files it).

`pipeline watch <run-id>` is the blocking completion primitive. It prints each
stage state transition once, returns `0` for succeeded, `1` for terminal
failed/blocked/cancelled, and `2` with `still running` when `--timeout` expires.
Use `--json` for the same final summary shape as `pipeline show --json`.

While a stage is queued or running, the run view adds an honest
`STATE; enqueued <elapsed> ago` detail (the stage timestamp is enqueue time, not
claim time). Long-running pipeline jobs publish a latest-only `progress` event
after one minute and about every 30 seconds thereafter. A running stage shows the
event's real age and last sanitized activity line; the age continues increasing if
the daemon dies. Orchestrate stages whose current coordinator has no fresh event
show `(sub-tree running; no per-stage progress)`. JSON stage objects add
`started_at`, `finished_at`, and an optional structured `progress` object.

`pipeline show <run-id>` also reports best-effort total tokens; JSON carries run
`tokens` plus per-stage `input_tokens` and `output_tokens` where captured. A zero
can mean the runtime/session shape did not report usage.

`pipeline resume` re-runs a **parked** (blocked/failed) run from its halted stage
(or `--from <stage>`) plus its transitive dependents — bumping their attempt — while
**never re-running a succeeded stage**; it refuses a non-parked run and a run whose
spec drifted. `ResumePipelineRun` is the #682 approval-gate seam. `pipeline cancel`
abandons a run through the shared `job cancel` path.

A pipeline stage is a **leaf**: a stage result carrying `delegations[]` does not
spawn children — the advancer ignores them and the engine strips them for a pipeline
stage job. Use an orchestra for dynamic fan-out, a pipeline for a fixed shell DAG.
See `docs/pipelines.md` for the full reference and `WORKFLOWS.md → Pipelines` for the
end-to-end story.

## Native Chat (agent threads)

`gitmoot chat` (#534, V1 local-only) is a durable, repo-aware **conversation
ledger** where registered agents and the human talk in threads, `@`-tag each
other, and (explicitly) promote a message into a real job. It is stored in local
SQLite alongside the rest of gitmoot state — **zero network, zero entmoot
dependency**. The core rule: **a message is a row (free); a job is compute
(explicit)**. A plain `chat send` never starts work — only `chat task` (promotion)
and `chat answer` (ask-gate resume) touch the dispatch path.

```sh
gitmoot chat create <name> --repo owner/repo [--topic "title"] [--json]
gitmoot chat list [--repo owner/repo] [--all] [--json]      # open threads; --all includes archived
gitmoot chat show <thread> [--repo owner/repo] [--limit N] [--json]
gitmoot chat send <thread> "message" [--as agent] [--repo owner/repo] [--ref kind:value ...] [--json]
gitmoot chat remember <thread> <message-seq> [--repo owner/repo] [--tier repo|general] [--agent NAME] [--json]
gitmoot chat inbox <agent> [--unread] [--json]
gitmoot chat task <thread> "@agent message" [--action ask|review|implement] [--repo owner/repo] [--json]
gitmoot chat answer <thread> "<question-id>: answer text" [--repo owner/repo] [--json]
gitmoot chat close|reopen <thread> [--repo owner/repo] [--json]
gitmoot chat rename <thread> "new name" [--repo owner/repo] [--json]
```

- **`create`** — `<name>` is slugified to a topic-path-safe handle (`[a-z0-9-]`, no
  `+`/`#`/`/`; unique per repo); a name that slugifies to nothing is rejected.
  `--repo` is required. `--topic` sets the human display title (defaults to the
  slug). The slug is the stable handle; a later `rename` changes only the title.
- **`send`** — appends a `chat` message. `@agent` mentions are parsed and, for
  **registered** agents, delivered as an unread **inbox** row; an unknown mention
  is recorded for audit with a stderr warning and **never fails the send**.
  `--as <agent>` authors the message as a registered agent (default: the human);
  `--ref kind:value` attaches structured refs (e.g. `--ref pr:42`). Sending to an
  archived thread is refused until you `reopen` it.
- **`remember`**: captures exactly one existing message by sequence as a memory
  observation. It stores the message body verbatim with deterministic provenance
  `chat:<thread-id>#<seq>`, applies the memory PreFilter, and dedups by content
  hash within the target scope/repo. It does not scan for natural-language
  prefixes, does not bulk-mine a thread, and does not self-trigger from agent
  messages. `--agent` is the capturing agent identity (default `lead`); `--tier`
  defaults to `repo`. If `[memory].ingest_auto_confirm = true`, the observation is
  immediately confirmed into that agent's private pool only. Shared memory remains
  explicit through `memory confirm --to-shared` or `memory promote --to-shared`.
- **`inbox`** — an agent's mentions, newest first; `--unread` restricts to unread.
- **`task`** — the one promotion verb. The body must name **exactly one**
  registered `@agent`; it records a `promotion_request` message, then dispatches a
  background job through the **same** validate → repo-scope → capability →
  autonomy-policy gate the daemon uses (`--action` defaults to `ask`). The message
  is back-linked to the job (`promoted_job_id`), and when the job reaches a terminal
  state the daemon appends its result into the thread as a **`job_result`** message
  (non-promotable, `reply_to` the promotion, with a `{kind:job}` ref). An identical
  `(thread, body)` promotion inside a 60 s window is refused (anti-ping-pong).
- **`answer`** — the local answer channel for the **#445 ask-gate**. When a job
  pauses at `awaiting_human` (its `human_questions[]`), the engine auto-creates (or
  reuses) a thread named `job-<hash>` and posts the questions as a **`system`**
  message carrying a `{kind:job}` ref. `chat answer <thread> "<id>: text"` routes
  that answer onto the existing resume path (`ResolveEscalation(answer)`), enqueuing
  the coordinator continuation that carries the answer and inherits the thread link.
- **`close`/`reopen`** — archive (audit-preserving) / restore a thread.

**Message kinds** are a fixed vocabulary: `chat` (a normal message),
`promotion_request` (a `task`), `job_result` (a back-linked terminal result —
never promotable, never mention-scanned), and `system` (engine-authored, e.g. the
ask-gate questions). Every thread/message/mention carries an **`origin`** stamped
with a generated stable per-DB `home_id` (never the literal `self`), and each
message stores a versioned canonical **envelope** — schema discipline that keeps a
future cross-machine bridge purely additive without changing any V1 runtime
behavior. See `WORKFLOWS.md → Chat` for the human↔agent thread story.
## Routing Telemetry (Advisory)

Gitmoot records lightweight **execution-grounded routing telemetry** (#530): one
additive row per job at its terminal transition, capturing which combination
actually ran and how it turned out — `repo`, `action` (ask/review/implement/
continuation/…), `phase`, `runtime`, `model`, `agent`, resolved `template_id` +
commit, terminal `job_state` (succeeded/failed/blocked), result `decision` +
approval flag, a coarse tests-run count, `duration_ms`, and `input`/`output`
tokens (best-effort; a runtime that reports no usage contributes 0). Capture is
**always on, additive, and fail-safe**: it writes only to the new
`routing_telemetry` table and a telemetry error can never fail a job, so wire
output is unchanged.

**v1 is advisory only.** Nothing reads this back to change routing — no automatic
model/runtime override happens anywhere. It is a local feedback loop you inspect,
not a global benchmark. (This capture slice subsumes the phase-aware capability
telemetry proposed in #522.)

Inspect observed performance (read-only), grouped by `(action, runtime, model,
template)`:

```sh
gitmoot router summary [--repo owner/repo] [--action ask|review|implement] [--since 30d] [--json]
```

It reports per-group count, success rate, approval rate, median duration, and
summed tokens, always labeled **"local observed performance, not a benchmark"**.
`--since` accepts a Go duration or an `<N>d` days suffix.

Optionally feed a **bounded** (≤12-line) observed-performance table into a
**coordinator's** prompt so it can weigh which runtime/model/template has done
well on the repo. It is **off by default**; with it off, coordinator prompt
assembly is byte-identical and no telemetry query runs during a job:

```toml
[router]
context_enabled = true   # inject the advisory table into top-level coordinator prompts (default false)
```

The injected block carries the same "not a benchmark" disclaimer and is only added
to top-level (coordinator) jobs — a delegation child inherits its coordinator's
routing decision. Routing stays advisory: the block never forces a route.

### V1.5 — auto-respond, `chat wait`, and `moot`

V1.5 (#534) adds the **agent-to-agent** layer on top of the V1 ledger. Both
additions are **off by default** and keep anti-ping-pong **structural**: only a
`kind=chat` message with a resolved mention ever triggers work, and every
back-linked reply is a non-triggering `kind=job_result`.

**Auto-respond sweep** — an opt-in daemon-tick sweep that lets an enrolled agent
answer an `@mention` without a human running `chat task`. It enqueues **one**
bounded read-only `ask` job per unread mention, through the same dispatch gate as
`chat task`. It is gated three ways and is a no-op (zero chat-table queries on the
tick) unless **both** the global switch and a per-agent opt-in are set:

- Global: `[chat] auto_respond = true` (default `false`).
- Per agent: `[agents.<name>] chat_autorespond = true` (default `false`).

Bounds (all in `[chat]`, warm-reloadable per tick / on SIGHUP):

| Knob | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `auto_respond` | `false` | Global kill switch; `false` overrides every per-agent opt-in. |
| `auto_respond_cap` | `4` | HARD cap on auto-responses per (thread, agent). At the cap the sweep **hard-stops** — no auto-extension — parks the trigger, and posts **one** visible `needs a human` system message. |
| `auto_respond_cooldown` | `2m` | Minimum spacing between auto-responses for the same (thread, agent). A trigger inside the window is deferred (left unread to re-fire), never dropped. |

A dispatched reply back-links as a `job_result` and marks the trigger mention read,
so the same mention can never double-fire; a failed enqueue leaves it unread to
retry next tick. The cap is a **real-time** bound: the sweep also counts the agent's
in-flight (queued/running) auto-respond asks, so a burst of mentions arriving before
the first reply lands can never stack past the cap. **Moot threads are excluded** from
the sweep entirely — a seat's `@mention` of a peer never double-drives that peer with
an extra ask on top of its seat job (auto-respond and `moot` compose, never stack).

**`chat wait`** — a blocking read verb (the moot turn-taking primitive): it polls
until the thread has a message with `seq > --since-seq`, then prints the new
messages plus a `last-seq: N` line (feed `N` as the next `--since-seq`). On a capped
moot thread it returns immediately with the wrap-up line instead of spinning to the
timeout.

```sh
gitmoot chat wait <thread> [--since-seq N] [--timeout 90s] [--repo owner/repo] [--json]
```

**`gitmoot moot`** — convene N registered agents as **seats** in one bounded
brainstorm. Each seat is **one** background read-only `ask` job dispatched through
the same validate → repo-scope → capability → policy gate as `chat task`; seats
converse in the thread by running `chat send` / `chat wait` as subprocesses, so the
compute cost is exactly **one job per seat** regardless of how many messages they
exchange. Messages are rows (free).

```sh
gitmoot moot <name> "topic" --agents a,b,c --repo owner/repo [--max-messages N] [--home ...] [--json]
```

- Roster validation is up front: every seat must be **registered**, **repo-scoped**,
  and carry the **`ask`** capability, or the whole moot is rejected before any
  thread is created or seat dispatched.
- The moot creates (or reuses an **open**) thread named `<name>`, stamps its hard
  cap, and posts a visible `MOOT convened` system message naming the seats + cap.
- The moot **HARD-STOPS** at its agent-message cap (owner design decision): there is
  **no** auto-extension. Once the thread hits the cap, `chat send --as` is refused
  with a distinctive error and **one** visible `MOOT CAP REACHED` overrun system
  message is posted; each seat then wraps up by returning its **partial conclusions**
  (what it knows / is unsure of / would ask next) as its `gitmoot_result`, which
  arrives via the `job_result` back-link path (the cap never blocks those). Human
  sends and seat conclusions are never gated by the cap.
- **Daemon relay**: seats converse **transparently** even under the runtime sandbox.
  The daemon serves a local **unix-socket chat relay**, and each moot seat's `chat send`
  / `chat wait` route through it to the (unsandboxed) daemon, which does the actual store
  write/read (the daemon injects a scoped, per-seat token bound to that seat's agent +
  thread). The gitmoot home stays **read-only** for the seat — only the daemon writes —
  so the read-only-home invariant holds. A human/CLI takes the byte-identical
  direct-store path.
- **Concurrency requirement**: seats are top-level read-only same-repo jobs. Each
  seat gets its own detached committed-tip **worktree at dispatch** (#739), so it is
  keyed off `worktree:<path>` instead of the shared `repo:<repo>` checkout key and
  same-repo seats converse concurrently under **either scheduler** as long as the
  daemon has **≥2 workers** (`--parallel N`, `[daemon] parallel = N`, or a per-repo
  `[repos."owner/repo"]` `max_parallel` override). Scheduler mode no longer matters
  (barrier batches the distinct-keyed seats per tick; pool runs them continuously).
  The only remaining serializer is a genuinely **single-worker** daemon
  (`parallel = 1`), where each seat's `chat wait` may time out and the moot degrades
  to sequential monologues. When it detects a single-worker daemon, `gitmoot moot`
  prints a **non-blocking** stderr warning (it still dispatches every seat) — give
  the daemon ≥2 workers so seats converse. Because a seat runs in a committed-tip
  worktree it sees the last committed state, not uncommitted edits (its prompt notes
  the canonical checkout), the same isolation read-only delegation children use.

Moot bounds (in `[chat]`, warm-reloadable):

| Knob | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `moot_max_seats` | `6` | Max agents one moot may convene; a larger roster is rejected. |
| `moot_message_cap` | `30` | Default HARD cap on agent-authored turns (overridable per-moot with `--max-messages`). |

`[chat]` is entirely optional: with no `[chat]` section every knob resolves to its
default, `auto_respond` stays off, and the daemon tick is byte-identical.

## Bridge (localhost HTTP for external automation)

```bash
gitmoot bridge serve [--addr 127.0.0.1:8791]   # localhost-only unless --allow-remote (dangerous)
gitmoot bridge token [--rotate]                 # prints the token FILE PATH, never the token
```

The bridge exposes a small authenticated HTTP surface over the same internal
seams the CLI uses (no new authority): POST /v1/pipelines/{name}/run,
GET /v1/runs/{id}, POST /v1/memory/recall, GET /v1/jobs/{id},
POST /v1/agents/{name}/ask. Every request needs
`Authorization: Bearer $(cat ~/.gitmoot/bridge.token)`. Requests are
rate-limited (30/min) and generally body-capped at 1 MiB. Pipeline run accepts no
body, `{}`, or `{"payload":{"key":"value"}}` for any enabled repo-bound pipeline.
Its raw body cap is 64 KiB: at most 32 entries, 1–64 byte lowercase identifier
keys, 32 KiB UTF-8 values without U+0000, and 48 KiB decoded keys+values. Invalid
payloads return 400, oversize 413, missing pipelines 404, and overlapping runs 409.
Containers reach the host
bridge at http://host.docker.internal:8791 (or the docker bridge IP on
Linux). Built for the Activepieces piece seam (issue #785); to connect Gmail as a pipeline trigger see WORKFLOWS.md -> Gmail -> Pipeline (Activepieces).

## Activepieces

```bash
gitmoot activepieces setup [--port 8080] [--url http://localhost:8080] [--yes]
gitmoot activepieces down [--volumes]
gitmoot activepieces connect gmail [--address user@example.com] [--password app-password] [--with-smtp]
gitmoot activepieces templates list
gitmoot activepieces templates import [flags] [id...]
```

`activepieces setup` bootstraps a local Activepieces 0.82.0, Postgres, and Redis
Compose stack, starts the Gitmoot bridge when needed, installs the public
`@gitmoot/piece-gitmoot`, creates the `gitmoot-bridge` connection, and imports
starter webhook and IMAP/SMTP flows. `--url` skips Docker for an existing local
Activepieces instance. Cloud Activepieces cannot reach the local bridge without
a separately secured path back to the host.

`activepieces connect gmail` creates and live-validates the `gmail-imap`
CUSTOM_AUTH connection. It prompts on a terminal; non-interactive use requires
`--address` and `--password`. `--with-smtp` additionally creates `gmail-smtp`;
the declarative receive-only trigger does not need it.

`activepieces down` preserves data volumes unless `--volumes` is set.
`templates import` skips flow display names that already exist. The email flow
requires a non-empty repo and sends only a queued-job acknowledgement because
`ask_agent` is asynchronous.
