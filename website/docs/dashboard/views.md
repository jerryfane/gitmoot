# Dashboard Views

The web dashboard has eight views, reachable from the left nav rail (or the mobile
bottom tab bar). Each is described below with its screenshot. See
[Dashboard Overview](./overview.md) for launching, routes, refresh cadences, and
security.

## Graph

Route: `/` (or `/?run=<id>`)

![Graph view: a per-run delegation DAG with the runs column and a node detail aside](/img/dashboard/graph.png)

The Graph view is a **single run's delegation DAG**. Nodes are the jobs in that
run's tree; edges are delegation parentage plus each child's declared
dependencies resolved to its sibling jobs. Node color tracks state, and the
selected run streams over SSE — running nodes pulse and settle live.

- **Runs column** (left): every orchestration run, active (running/queued) runs
  first. A search box matches over run title and prompt snippet, and facets
  filter by **status, kind, agent, and repo** (AND across categories, OR within
  one). Selecting a run loads its graph and updates the URL to `/?run=<id>`.
- **Node detail aside** (right): click a node to open its prompt, output, event
  timeline, agent/runtime/model, state, depth, and a link to its pull request
  when one exists.

## Galaxy

Route: `/galaxy`

![Galaxy view: a whole-history force graph with repo and agent hubs](/img/dashboard/galaxy.png)

Galaxy is the **whole-history force graph** — every job across every run in one
canvas, clustered around synthetic **repo** and **agent** hub nodes. Links are
delegation parentage, a per-parent sibling mesh (capped so one huge fan-out can't
dominate the density), and job-to-repo / job-to-agent spokes.

- Running jobs render as live **beacons** (floored to a minimum on-screen size so
  they stay visible when zoomed out) and pulse.
- **Flowing particles** travel the links touching a running job (bright and fast),
  with a subtle slow particle on ordinary delegation links, so active work is
  legible from the zoomed-out view.
- A **repository** filter scopes the visible jobs and their hubs to one repo; the
  filter list always stays complete regardless of the current scope.
- Clicking a node opens the same detail panel (pinned right on desktop, a
  full-screen sheet on mobile). A readout shows how many nodes and links are
  currently drawn.

## Jobs

Route: `/jobs` (or `/jobs?agent=<name>`)

![Jobs view: a filterable table of every job across all runs](/img/dashboard/jobs.png)

Jobs is a flat, filterable view of **every job across every run**, newest activity
first. It renders as a table on desktop (columns: Title, Agent, Repo, Kind, Depth,
Tokens, Started, Duration) and as cards on mobile.

- A search box matches over **title, agent, id, and repo**; facets filter by
  **State, Repo, and Agent** (the `?agent=` route pre-selects the agent facet).
- The table is capped at **400 rows** after filtering; when more match, a footer
  reads `showing 400 of N — refine filters`, and a running `showing X of Y`
  count sits in the header.
- Clicking a row (or card) opens a detail panel with the job's prompt, output,
  and event history.

## Pipelines

Route: `/pipelines` (or `/pipelines/<name>`)

Pipelines is the read-only view of the declared **shell-stage pipelines** — the
scheduled/manual DAGs defined with `gitmoot pipeline add`. It is **strictly
read-only**: every action it surfaces is a **copyable command**, never a mutation.
When no pipeline is declared yet, the view shows an empty state prompting
`gitmoot pipeline add <spec.yaml>`.

**List view** — a table, one row per pipeline (columns: **Name**, **Repo**,
**Enabled** chip, **Schedule** rendered as `every 24h +15m`, **Last run** state
chip, **Next due** countdown rendered from the schedule as e.g. `due in 6h 12m`
and recomputed each poll, and a **Recent** outcomes strip of the last ≤10 runs as
small state-colored squares, oldest→newest left to right). Clicking a row opens
that pipeline's detail (`/pipelines/<name>`).

**Detail view** — a back link, a pipeline header (name, repo, enabled, schedule,
next due), and a **run-history strip** of recent runs (each a chip: state color,
short run id, relative time). Selecting a run (newest by default) renders that
run's **stage DAG** and, when the run parked, a banner:

- a **blocked** run shows an amber banner with the halt stage, halt reason, the
  outstanding **needs**, and a copyable `gitmoot pipeline resume <run-id>`;
- a **failed** run shows a red banner with the halt reason and a copyable
  `gitmoot report bug --job <failing-stage-job-id>`.

The **stage DAG** lays stages out in dependency (depth) columns, left to right,
edges following the spec's `needs`. Each stage chip shows its id, state, attempt
(when it retried), elapsed time, and a one-line summary; pending and skipped
stages render dimmed. Clicking a stage opens a side panel: stages with a job show
the full job detail (prompt, output, events) fetched from `/api/job/<id>`; a
pending or skipped stage (no job yet) shows a minimal card with its id, state,
command, and dependencies. An in-flight run's stages flip live as the dashboard
polls (every 12s).

The detail view also fetches `/api/pipelines/<name>` for the pipeline's full
history and declared shape. It shows a **run-history table** — one row per run
(newest-first, capped at the last 100), with started time (absolute and
relative), trigger, state chip, duration, and halt stage — where selecting a row
drives the strip, matrix, and DAG together. A **stage×run matrix** places the
stages down the rows (declared order first, any history-only ids appended) and
the most recent runs across the columns oldest→newest, each cell a
state-colored dot, so a stage that keeps failing reads as a streak across a row;
clicking a cell selects that run. When the pipeline has a schedule, an
**upcoming card** projects the next few fire times from `next due + k × interval`
(with the jitter suffixed when set); a disabled schedule shows *paused* and a
manual-only pipeline shows the copyable `gitmoot pipeline run <name>`. A pipeline
that has **never run** renders its **declared DAG** (every stage pending, from
the current spec) as a preview instead of a run. This detail feed is strictly
read-only and deterministic; the list rows additionally summarize each pipeline's
recent success rate and average duration.

## Learning

Route: `/learning` (opens `/learning/skills`; second tab `/learning/knowledge`)

Learning is one nav item with two tabs telling one story: what the agents are
learning. **Skills** is the SkillOpt evolution overview — one row per agent
template with its version history as an inline score-trend sparkline, the
current version, any active canary, and pending candidates (each expandable to
a copy-paste `gitmoot skillopt candidate promote` command). Clicking a row
jumps to that agent's detail panel. **Knowledge** is the memory brain graph —
enrolled agents as wells, their remembered facts as nodes sized by how often
they were reinforced, and owner/category/supersede edges between them; clicking
a fact or agent opens its detail panel. Both tabs are read-only and poll every
12 seconds.

## Agents

Route: `/agents` (or `/agents/<name>`)

![Agents view: a grid of agent cards with per-agent stats](/img/dashboard/agents.png)

Agents is a grid of cards — one per registered agent, plus a single rollup card
for the fleet of ephemeral workers. Each card shows the agent's runtime, role,
model, repo scope, and job tallies (total, running, succeeded, failed) with its
last-active time.

Clicking a card opens the agent detail (`/agents/<name>`):

![Agent detail: the template card and full prompt viewer with a copy button](/img/dashboard/agent-detail.png)

- **Template card** — the agent's template identity (name, description, source
  repo/ref/path, resolved commit) and the **full prompt viewer**: the exact
  resolved prompt body an agent runs, with a **copy** button.
- **Version history** — every template version, newest first, with the version
  Gitmoot currently resolves to marked. Each version carries its own full prompt
  and a collapsed-by-default **diff** toggle that shows a **unified diff against
  its predecessor version** (long unchanged runs collapse to their first and last
  few lines):

![Agent detail: a unified diff between two template versions](/img/dashboard/agent-diff.png)

## Charts

Route: `/charts`

![Charts view: activity time series and top agents/repos](/img/dashboard/charts.png)

Charts summarizes activity over a selectable window — **7d, 30d, 90d, or all**
history (default 30d):

- **Jobs per day**, stacked by state (succeeded, failed, cancelled, blocked,
  queued, running), zero-filled continuously across the range.
- **Tokens per day** (input and output).
- **Top agents** and **Top repos** by job count (each capped at the busiest 12).

The series and totals reflect the selected range and refresh on the standard 12s
cadence.

## Health

Route: `/health`

![Health view: daemon status, state totals, stuck jobs, locks, and recent failures](/img/dashboard/health.png)

Health is the operability view for unattended runs:

- **Daemon** — running/stopped, PID, uptime, the running binary's version, and an
  update chip (`up to date`, or `update available: <version>` linking to the
  release).
- **State totals** — a chip per state (queued, running, blocked, succeeded,
  failed, cancelled).
- **Stuck jobs** — blocked jobs (surfaced at any age) plus queued jobs older than
  10 minutes, each with a **derived why-stuck reason** (from the job's latest
  reason event and any resource lock it is waiting on) and how long it has been
  wedged.
- **Locks** — branch/checkout locks (`repo@branch`, owner, acquired time) and
  non-branch resource locks such as runtime sessions (key, owner, acquired,
  expires).
- **Recent failures** — the ten newest failed jobs.

A blocked job stays blocked until you clear it or a sweep does. Use
`gitmoot job cancel <job-id>` to abandon one, or `gitmoot job cancel --state
blocked` to clear a backlog; set `[orchestrate].blocked_ttl` to sweep old blocked
jobs automatically, and run `gitmoot doctor` for the environment preflight that
warns about a blocked-job pileup. All of these are documented under
[Jobs And Locks](../reference/cli.md#jobs-and-locks).
