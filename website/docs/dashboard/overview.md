# Dashboard Overview

The web dashboard is a **read-only, live browser view** over your local Gitmoot
store. It renders the same state the `gitmoot dashboard` TUI shows — runs, jobs,
agents, locks, daemon health — but as an orchestration graph you can watch update
in real time, with click-through to each job's prompt and output.

It is strictly read-only: it never mutates workflow state, never touches the
daemon path, and exposes no action controls. To *act* on a job (retry, cancel,
answer a prompt) use the CLI or the interactive TUI — see the
[CLI Reference](../reference/cli.md#jobs-and-locks).

## Launching it

```sh
gitmoot dashboard --web                       # serve on 127.0.0.1:8080
gitmoot dashboard --web --addr 127.0.0.1:9000 # pick another localhost port
```

`--web` starts a foreground HTTP server and blocks until interrupted (Ctrl-C).
On start it prints the bound address:

```
gitmoot dashboard serving read-only at http://127.0.0.1:8080 (Ctrl-C to stop)
```

- `--addr` sets the listen address. The default is **`127.0.0.1:8080`**
  (localhost only).
- The server is separate from the daemon — it reads the store directly, so it
  works whether or not the daemon is running (a stopped daemon simply shows as
  stopped on the Health page).
- `--web` is one mode of `gitmoot dashboard`; without it the command runs the
  interactive TUI or a one-shot snapshot instead. See the
  [`dashboard` command](../reference/cli.md#repo-and-daemon-status) for the full
  flag set.

## Routes

The UI is a single-page app with client-side routing (the browser URL updates as
you navigate, so every view is linkable and reloadable):

| Route | View |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | Graph — the delegation DAG of the most-recent active run |
| `/?run=<id>` | Graph scoped to a specific run |
| `/galaxy` | Galaxy — the whole-history force graph |
| `/jobs` | Jobs — every job across every run |
| `/jobs?agent=<name>` | Jobs pre-filtered to one agent |
| `/agents` | Agents — one card per registered agent |
| `/agents/<name>` | Agent detail (template, prompt, version history) |
| `/charts` | Charts — activity time series |
| `/health` | Health — daemon status, totals, stuck jobs, locks, failures |

Unknown paths normalize back to `/`. Each view is backed by a small read-only
JSON API (`/api/runs`, `/api/jobs`, `/api/agents`, `/api/agent/{name}`,
`/api/charts`, `/api/health`, `/api/state`, `/api/job/{id}`, `/api/graph`) plus a
Server-Sent Events stream at `/events`.

See [Dashboard Views](./views.md) for what each view shows.

## Auto-refresh

The dashboard stays live without a manual reload:

- **Graph** — the runs column reloads every **15s**; the selected run's graph
  streams over **SSE** (`/events?run=<id>`), so nodes change state as the
  orchestra runs (running nodes pulse).
- **Galaxy, Jobs, Agents, Charts, Health** — each polls its data every **12s**
  while it is the active view (background views do not poll).
- **Health** additionally re-renders its relative-time cells every second, so
  "stuck for N minutes" and daemon uptime tick live between polls.

## Mobile

The UI is responsive at a **768px** breakpoint (also treating coarse-pointer
devices as touch). On a phone the 216px left nav rail is replaced by a 60px
**bottom tab bar**, detail panels (node, job, agent) open as **full-screen
sheets**, the Jobs table collapses to cards, and the Graph runs column becomes a
full-screen drawer reachable from a floating "Runs" tab. Desktop rendering is
unchanged.

## Security

The dashboard serves **private data**: job prompts, agent outputs, template
bodies, repo names and lock owners are all visible to anyone who can reach the
port. There is **no authentication** built in.

By default `--web` binds to `127.0.0.1:8080`, reachable only from the local
machine — keep it that way for normal use. If you must expose it beyond
localhost, do **not** bind it to a public interface directly. Bind it to an
internal address and put an authenticating layer in front of it — a reverse
proxy that enforces auth, or a zero-trust access proxy (e.g. an identity-aware
proxy or a private tunnel). The dashboard trusts every request it receives.
