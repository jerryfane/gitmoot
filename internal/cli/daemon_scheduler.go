// which the multi-repo supervisor invokes once per enabled repo (18×/tick on the
// affected VPS). The most expensive of the three (JobIDsWithPendingAdvanceRetry)
// materialized ~23.67 MiB of row fetches per call, so re-running it per repo was
// the single largest source of the daemon's idle read volume. Hoisting it here
// keeps per-repo filtering exactly where it was (in Go, in the retry passes) while
// collapsing the shared query to one execution.
//
// Two memoization properties, both implemented once in candidateMemo.get:
//
//  1. SUCCESSES are computed once per tick and shared across every repo's pass, so
//     each query runs once per tick, not once per enabled repo. A job that begins
//     qualifying mid-sweep is therefore not observed until the next tick's fresh
//     carrier — a deliberate, bounded one-tick staleness that self-corrects on the
//     following tick. The carrier is created FRESH each tick (so a candidate that
//     stops qualifying next tick is re-evaluated) and MUST NOT be stored on the
//     long-lived tracker/worker.
//  2. ERRORS are NOT memoized. A failed query leaves the memo unset so the next
//     repo's pass RE-RUNS it. This preserves the per-repo fault isolation the
//     pre-#619 per-repo queries had: a transient store fault (e.g. a single
//     SQLITE_BUSY) fails only the repo that hit it and can self-heal for the rest
//     of the sweep, instead of being replayed to all 18 repos — which would make
//     failed==enabled, error the whole sweep, and feed the consecutive-tick daemon
//     self-exit streak #619 is closing.
//
// No mutex/sync.Once: it is consumed ONLY on the synchronous tick goroutine — the
// per-repo loop in runEnabledRepoWorkerTicksTracked is sequential, and dispatched
// jobs run on their own goroutines and never touch it.
//
